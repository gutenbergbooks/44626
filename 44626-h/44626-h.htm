<p>Dedicated to my nieces, who will find in English and American publications
such epithets applied to their ancestors as: &ldquo;Cruel slave-owners;&rdquo; &ldquo;inhuman;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Southern task masters;&rdquo; &ldquo;hard-hearted;&rdquo; &ldquo;dealers in human souls,&rdquo;
&amp;c. From these they will naturally recoil with horror. My own life would
have been embittered had I believed myself descended from such; and that
those who come after us may know the truth I wish to leave a record of plantation
life as it was. The truth may thus be preserved among a few, and the
praise they deserve awarded noble men and virtuous women who have passed
away.</p>

<p>For several years I have felt a desire to write these reminiscences, but did
not conclude to do so until receiving, a few months ago, a letter from Mr.
Martin F. Tupper&mdash;the English poet&mdash;in which he wrote: &ldquo;Let me encourage
you in the idea of writing &lsquo;Plantation Reminiscences.&rsquo; It will be a good
work; and it is time the world was learning the truth. I myself have learned
it and shall not be slow in telling it to others.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a></h2>

<p>That my birth place should have been a Virginia plantation; my
lot in life cast on a Virginia plantation; my ancestors, for nine generations,
owners of Virginia plantations, remain facts mysterious
and inexplicable but to Him who determined the bounds of our
habitations, and said: &ldquo;Be still, and know that I am God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Confined exclusively to a Virginia plantation, during my earliest
childhood, I believed the world one vast plantation bounded by negro
quarters. Rows of white cabins with gardens attached; negro men
in the fields; negro women sewing, knitting, spinning, weaving,
house-keeping in the cabins, with negro children dancing, romping,
singing, jumping, playing around the doors, formed the only pictures
familiar to my childhood.</p>

<p>The master&rsquo;s residence&mdash;as the negroes called it, the &ldquo;great
house&rdquo;&mdash;occupied a central position, and was handsome and attractive;
the overseer&rsquo;s being a plainer house, about a mile from this.</p>

<p>Each cabin had as much pine furniture as the occupants desired;
pine and oak being abundant, and carpenters always at work for the
comfort of the plantation.</p>

<p>Bread, meat, milk, vegetables, fruit and fuel were as plentiful as
water in the springs near the cabin doors.</p>

<p>Among the negroes&mdash;one hundred&mdash;on our plantation, many had
been taught different trades; and there were blacksmiths, carpenters,
brick masons, millers, shoemakers, weavers, spinners, all working
for themselves. No article of their handicraft ever being sold from the
place, their industry resulted in nothing beyond feeding and clothing
themselves.</p>

<p>My sister and myself, when very small children, were often carried
to visit these cabins, on which occasions no young princesses could
have received from admiring subjects more adulation. Presents
were laid at our feet&mdash;not glittering gems&mdash;but eggs, chesnuts, popcorn,
walnuts, melons, apples, sweet potatoes, all their &ldquo;cupboards&rdquo;
afforded, with a generosity unbounded. This made us as happy as
queens; and filled our hearts with kindness and gratitude to our
dusky admirers.</p>

<p>Around the cabin doors the young negroes would quarrel as to who
should be his or her mistress; some claiming me, and others my sister.</p>

<p>All were merry-hearted, and among them I never saw a discontented
face. Their amusements were dancing to the music of the
banjo, quilting parties, opossum hunting, and, sometimes, weddings
and parties.</p>

<p>Many could read, and in almost every cabin was a Bible. In one
was a Prayer-book, kept by one of the men&mdash;a preacher&mdash;from which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
he read the marriage ceremony at the weddings. This man opened
a night school&mdash;charging twenty-five cents a week&mdash;hoping to inspire
some literary thirst among the rising generation, who, however,
preferred their nightly frolics to the school, so it had few patrons.</p>

<p>Our house servants were numerous, polite and well trained. My
mother selected those most obliging in disposition and quick at learning,
who were brought to the house at ten or twelve years of age, and
instructed in the branches of household employment.</p>

<p>These small servants were always dressed in the cleanest, whitest
long-sleeved aprons, with white or red turbans on their heads. No
establishment being considered complete without a multiplicity of
these; they might be seen constantly darting about on errands from
the house to the kitchen and the cabins; up stairs and down stairs,
being indeed omnipresent and indispensable.</p>

<p>It was the custom for a lady visitor to be accompanied to her room
at night by one of these black, smiling &ldquo;indispensables,&rdquo; who insisted
so good naturedly on performing all offices, combing her hair,
pulling off her slippers, &amp;c., that one had not the heart to refuse, although
it would have been sometimes more agreeable to have been
left alone.</p>

<p>The negroes were generally pleased at the appearance of visitors,
from whom they were accustomed to receive some present on arriving
or departing, the neglect of which was considered a breach of
politeness.</p>

<p>The old negroes were quite patriarchal; loved to talk about &ldquo;old
times,&rdquo; and exacted great respect from the young negroes, and also
from the younger members of the white family. We called the old
men &ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; and the old women &ldquo;Aunt,&rdquo; cognomens of respect.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of our own home was consideration and kindness.
The mere recital of a tale of suffering would make my sister and myself
weep with sorrow. And I believe the maltreatment of one of
our servants&mdash;we had never heard the word &ldquo;slave&rdquo;&mdash;would have
distressed us beyond endurance. We early learned that happiness
consisted in dispensing it, and found no pleasure greater than saving
our old dolls, toys, beads, bits of cake, or candy for the cabin children,
whose delight at receiving them richly repaid us. If any of the
older servants became displeased with us, we were miserable until
we had restored the old smile by presenting some choice bit of sweet
meat, cake or candy.</p>

<p>I remember once, when my grand-mother scolded nurse Kitty, saying:
&ldquo;Kitty, the butler tells me you disturb the breakfast cream every
morning, dipping out milk to wash your face,&rdquo; I burst in tears, and
thought it hard when there were so many cows poor Kitty could not
wash her face in milk. Kitty had been told that her dark skin would
be improved by a milk bath, which she had not hesitated to dip every
morning from the breakfast buckets.</p>

<p>At such establishments one easily acquired a habit of being waited
upon&mdash;there being so many servants with so little to do. It was
natural to ask for a drink of water, when the water was right by
you, and have things brought which you might easily have gotten
yourself. But these domestics were so pleased at such errands one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
felt no hesitation in requiring them. A young lady would ask black
Nancy or Dolly to fan her, whereupon Nancy or Dolly would laugh
good naturedly, produce a large palm leaf and fall to fanning her
young mistress vigorously, after which she would be rewarded with
a bow of ribbon, candy or sweet cakes.</p>

<p>The negroes made pocket money by selling their own vegetables,
poultry, eggs, &amp;c.&mdash;made at the master&rsquo;s expense, of course. I often
saw my mother take out her purse and pay them liberally for fowls,
eggs, melons, sweet potatoes, brooms, shuck mats and split baskets.
The men made small crops of tobacco or potatoes for themselves on
any piece of ground they chose to select.</p>

<p>My mother and grand-mother were almost always talking over the
wants of the negroes,&mdash;what medicine should be sent&mdash;who they
should visit&mdash;who needed new shoes, clothes or blankets,&mdash;the principle
object of their lives seeming to be providing these comforts.
The carriage was often ordered for them to ride around to the cabins
to distribute light-bread, tea and other necessaries among the sick.
And besides employing the best doctor, my grand-mother always
saw that they received the best nursing and attention.</p>

<p>In this little plantation world of ours was one being&mdash;and only
one&mdash;who inspired awe in every heart, being a special terror to
small children. This was the Queen of the Kitchen&mdash;Aunt Christian&mdash;who
reigned supreme. She wore the whitest cotton cap, with
the broadest of ruffles; was very black and very portly, and her
sceptre was a good sized stick, kept to chastise small dogs and children
who invaded her territory. Her character, however, having
been long established she had not often occasion to use this weapon,
as these enemies kept out of her way.</p>

<p>Her pride was great, for, said she: &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I been, long before
this here little master whar is was born, bakin&rsquo; the best light-bread
and waffles and biscuit; and in my old master&rsquo;s time managed my
own affars!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was generally left to manage &ldquo;her own affars,&rdquo; and being a
pattern of neatness and industry her fame went abroad from Botetourt,
even unto the remotest ends of Mecklenburg county.</p>

<p>That this marvellous cooking was all the work of her own hands
I am, in later years, inclined to doubt, as she kept several assistants,
a boy to chop wood, beat biscuit, scour tables, lift off pots and ovens;
one woman to make the pastry and another to compound cakes and
jellies. But her fame was great; her pride lofty, and I would not
now pluck one laurel from her wreath.</p>

<p>This honest woman was appreciated by my mother, but we had
no affinity for her, in consequence of certain traditions on the plantation
about her severity to children. Having no children of her own,
a favorite orphan house-girl, whenever my mother went from home,
was left to her care. This girl&mdash;now an elderly woman, and still our
faithful and loved servant,&mdash;says she remembers to this day her
joy at my mother&rsquo;s return home, and her release from Aunt Christian.
&ldquo;I will never forget,&rdquo; to use her own words, &ldquo;how I watched the road
every day, hoping that mistress would come back, and when I saw
the carriage I would run a mile, shouting and clapping my hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>Smiling faces always welcomed us home as the carriage passed
through the plantation, and on reaching the house we were received
by the negroes about the yard with liveliest demonstrations of pleasure.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p>It was a long time before it dawned upon my mind there were
places and people different from these. The plantations we visited
seemed exactly like ours. The same hospitality everywhere, the
same kindliness existing between the white family and the blacks.</p>

<p>Confined exclusively to plantation scenes, the most trifling incidents
impressed themselves indelibly upon me.</p>

<p>One day while my mother was in the yard attending to the planting
of some shrubbery, we saw approaching an old, feeble negro man,
leaning upon his stick. His clothes were nearly worn out, and he,
haggard and thin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, Mistess,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; asked my mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is John,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and I belonged to your husband&rsquo;s
uncle. He died a long time ago. Before he died he set me free and
gave me a good piece of land near Petersburg, and some money and
stock. But all&mdash;my money and land&mdash;all gone, and I was starving.
So I come one hundred miles to beg you and master please let me
live and die on your plantation. I don&rsquo;t want to be free no longer.
Please don&rsquo;t let me be free.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I wondered what was meant by being &ldquo;free,&rdquo; and supposed from
his appearance it must be some very dreadful and unfortunate condition
of humanity. My mother heard him very kindly, and directed
him to the kitchen where &ldquo;Aunt Christian&rdquo; would give him a plenty
to eat.</p>

<p>Although there were already a number of old negroes to be supported,
who no longer considered themselves young enough to work,
this old man was added to the number, and a cabin built for him.
To the day of his death he expressed gratitude to my mother for taking
care of him, and often entertained us with accounts of <i>his</i> &ldquo;old master&rsquo;s
times,&rdquo; which he said were the &ldquo;grandest of all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By way of apology for certain knotty excrescences on his feet, he
used to say: &ldquo;You see these here knots. Well, they come from my
being a monstrous proud young nigger, and squeezin&rsquo; my feet in de
tightest boots to drive my master&rsquo;s carriage &rsquo;bout Petersburg. I
nuver was so happy as when I was drivin&rsquo; my coach-an&rsquo;-four, and
crackin&rsquo; de postillion over de head wid my whip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These pleasant reminiscences were generally concluded with:
&ldquo;Ah! young Misses, <i>you&rsquo;ll</i> nuver see sich times. No more postillions!
No more coach-an&rsquo;-four! And niggers drives <i>now</i> widout they white
gloves. Ah! no, young Misses, <i>you&rsquo;ll</i> nuver see nothin&rsquo;! <i>Nuver</i>, in
<i>your</i> time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these melancholy predictions would he shake his head, and
sigh that the days of glory had departed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>Each generation of blacks vied with the other in extolling the virtues
of their particular mistress and master and &ldquo;<i>their times</i>;&rdquo; but
notwithstanding this mournful contrast between the past and present,
their reminiscences had a certain charm. Often by their cabin firesides
would we listen to the tales of the olden days about our forefathers,
of whom they could tell much, having belonged to our family
since the landing of the African fathers on the English slave ships,
from which their ancestors had been bought by ours. Among these
traditions none pleased us so much as that an unkind mistress or
master had never been known among our ancestors, which we have
always considered a cause for greater pride than the armorial bearings
left on their tombstones.</p>

<p>We often listened with pleasure to the recollections of an old blind
man&mdash;the former faithful attendant of our grand-father&mdash;whose mind
was filled with vivid pictures of the past. He repeated verbatim
conversations and speeches heard sixty years before&mdash;from Mr. Madison,
Mr. Jefferson, Mr. Clay, and other statesmen, his master&rsquo;s special
friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he used to say, &ldquo;I staid with your grandpa ten years in
Congress, and all the time he was Secretary for President Jefferson.
He nuver give me a cross word, and I nuver saw your grandma the
least out of temper neither, but once, and that was at a dinner party
&lsquo;we&rsquo; give in Washington, when the French Minister said something
disrespectful about the United States.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Often did he tell us: &ldquo;The greatest pleasure I expect in heaven, is
seeing my old master.&rdquo; And sometimes, &ldquo;I dream about my master
and mistress when I am sleep, and talk with them and see them so
plain it makes me so happy that I laugh out right loud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This man was true and honest&mdash;a good Christian. Important
trusts had been confided to him. He frequently carried the carriage
and horses to Washington and Baltimore&mdash;a journey of two weeks&mdash;and
sometimes sent to carry a large sum of money to a distant county.</p>

<p>His wife, who had accompanied him in her youth to Washington,
also entertained us with gossip about the people of that day, and
could tell exactly the size and color of Mrs. Madison&rsquo;s slippers, how
she was dressed on certain occasions, &ldquo;what beautiful manners she
had,&rdquo; how Mr. Jefferson received master and mistress when &ldquo;we&rdquo;
drove up to Monticello, what room they occupied, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Although my grand-father&rsquo;s death occurred thirty years before, the
negroes still remembered it with sorrow; and one of them, speaking
of it, said to me, &ldquo;Ah, little mistess, &rsquo;twas a sorrowful day when de
news come from Washington dat our good, kind master was dead.
A mighty wail went up from dis plantation, for we know&rsquo;d we had
loss our bes friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The only negro on the place who did not evince an interest in the
white family was a man ninety years old, who, forty years before,
announced his intention of not working any longer&mdash;although
still strong and athletic&mdash;because, he said, &ldquo;the estate had done come
down so he hadn&rsquo;t no heart to work no longer.&rdquo; He remembered,
he said, &ldquo;when thar was three and four hundred black folks, but sence
de British debt had to be paid over by his old master, and de Mack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>lenbug
estate had to be sold, he hadn&rsquo;t had no heart to do nothin&rsquo;
sence.&rdquo; And &ldquo;he hadn&rsquo;t seen no <i>real</i> fine white folks&mdash;what <i>he</i> called
real fine white folks&mdash;sence he come from Macklenbug.&rdquo; All his interest
in life having expired with an anterior generation; we were in
his eyes but a poor set, and he refused to have anything to do with
us. Not being compelled to work, he passed his life principally in
the woods, wore a rabbit-skin cap and a leather apron. Having lost
interest in, and connection with the white family, he gradually relapsed
into a state of barbarism, refusing towards the end of his life
to sleep in his bed, preferring a hard bench in his cabin, upon which
he died.</p>

<p>Another very old man remembered something of his father, who
had come from Africa; and when we asked him to tell us what he
remembered of his father&rsquo;s narrations, would say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father told us that his mother lived in a hole in the ground,
and when the English people come to Africa she sold him for a string
of beads. He said &lsquo;&rsquo;twas mighty hard for him, when he fus come to
dis country, to wear clothes.&rsquo; Sometimes he would git so mad wid
us chillun, my mammy would have to run and hide us to keep him
from killin&rsquo; us. Den sometimes at night he would say: &lsquo;He gwine sing
he country,&rsquo; den he would dance and jump and howl and skeer us to
death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They spoke always of their forefathers as the &ldquo;outlandish people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On some plantations it was a custom to buy the wife when a negro
preferred to marry on another estate. And in this way we became
possessed of a famous termagant, who had married our grand-father&rsquo;s
gardener, quarrelled him to death in one year and survived to quarrel
forty years longer with the other negroes. She had no children&mdash;not
even a cat or dog could live with her. She had been offered her freedom,
but refused to accept it. Several times had been given away;
once to her son&mdash;a free man&mdash;and to others with whom she fancied
she might live, but, like the bad penny, was always returned to us.
She always returned in a cart, seated on top of her chest and surrounded
by her goods and chattels, dressed in a high hat, long black
plume&mdash;standing straight up&mdash;gay cloth spencer and short petticoat,
the costume of a hundred years ago. Although her return was a sore
affliction to the plantation, my sister and myself found much amusement
in witnessing it. The cold welcome she received seemed not
to affect her spirits, but re-establishing herself in her cabin she quickly
resumed the turbulent course of her career.</p>

<p>Finally one morning the news came that this woman, old Clara,
was dead. Two women went to sweep her cabin and perform the
last sad offices. They waited all day for the body to get cold. While
sitting over the fire in the evening, one of them happening to glance
at a small mirror inserted in the wall near the bed, exclaimed: &ldquo;Old
Clara&rsquo;s laughing!&rdquo; They went nearer and there was a horrible grin
on the face of the corpse! Old Clara sprang out of bed exclaiming,
&ldquo;Git me some meat and bread. I&rsquo;m most perish&rsquo;d!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old woman, what you mean by foolin&rsquo; us so?&rdquo; asked the nurses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I jes want see what you all gwine do wid my <i>things</i> when I <i>was</i>
dead!&rdquo; replied the old woman, whose &ldquo;things&rdquo; consisted of all sorts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
old and curious spencers, hats, plumes, necklaces, caps and dresses,
collected during her various wanderings and worn by a long past generation.</p>

<p>Among these old cabin legends we sometimes collected bits of romance,
and were often told how, by the coquetry of a certain Richmond
belle, we had lost a handsome fortune, which impressed me
even then with the fatal consequences of coquetry.</p>

<p>This belle engaged herself to our great uncle&mdash;a handsome and accomplished
gentleman&mdash;who, to improve his health, went to Europe;
but before embarking made his will, leaving her his estate and negroes.
He died abroad, and the lady accepted his property, although
she was known to have been engaged to twelve others at the same
time! The story in Richmond ran that these twelve gentlemen&mdash;my
grand-father among them&mdash;had a wine party, and towards the close
of the evening some of them becoming communicative, began taking
each other out to tell a secret when it was discovered they all had
the same secret&mdash;each was engaged to Miss Betsy M&mdash;&mdash;. This lady&rsquo;s
name is still seen on fly leaves of old books in our library&mdash;books
used during her reign by students at William and Mary College&mdash;showing
that the young gentlemen, even at that venerable Institution,
allowed their classic thoughts sometimes to wander.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p>As soon as my sister and myself had learned to read and cipher,
we were inspired with a desire to teach the negroes who were about
the house and kitchen; and my father promised to reward my sister
with a handsome guitar if she would teach two boys&mdash;designed for
mechanics&mdash;arithmetic.</p>

<p>Our regular system was every night to place chairs around the
dining table, ring a bell and open school; she presiding at one end
and I at the other of the table, each propped on books to give us the
necessary height and dignity for teachers.</p>

<p>Our school proved successful. The boys learned arithmetic and
the guitar was awarded. All who tried learned to read, and from
that day we have never ceased to teach all who desired to learn.</p>

<p>Thus my early life was passed amid scenes cheerful and agreeable,
nor did any one seem to have any care except my mother. Her
cares and responsibilities were great, with one hundred people continually
upon her mind, who were constantly appealing to her in
every strait, real or imaginary. But it had pleased God to place her
here, and nobly did she perform the duties of her station. She often
told us of her distress on realizing for the first time the responsibilities
devolving upon the mistress of a large plantation, and the nights
of sorrow and tears these thoughts had given her.</p>

<p>On her arrival at the plantation after her marriage, the negroes
received her with lively demonstrations of joy, clapping their hands
and shouting: &ldquo;Thank God, we got a mistess!&rdquo; Some of them
throwing themselves on the ground at her feet in their enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The plantation had been without a master or mistress twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
years; my father&mdash;the sole heir&mdash;having been off at school and College.
During this time the silver had been left in the house, and the
servants had kept and used it, but <i>nothing had been stolen</i>.</p>

<p>The books, too, had been undisturbed in the library, except a few
volumes of the poets which had been carried to adorn some of the
cabin shelves.</p>

<p>It was known by the negroes that their old master&rsquo;s will set them
free and gave them a large body of land in the event of my father&rsquo;s
death; and some of his College friends suggested he might be killed
while passing his vacations on his estate. But this only amused
him, for he knew too well in what affection he was held by his negroes,
and how each vied with the other in showing him attention&mdash;spreading
a dinner often for him at their cabins when he returned
from hunting or fishing.</p>

<p>I think I have written enough to show the mutual affection existing
between the white and black races&mdash;and the abundant provision
generally made for the wants of those whom God had mysteriously
placed under our care.</p>

<p>The existence of extreme want and poverty had never entered my
mind, until one day my mother showing us some pictures, entitled
&ldquo;London Labor and London Poor,&rdquo; we asked her if she believed there
were such poor people in the world, and she replied: &ldquo;Yes, children,
there are many in this world who have nowhere to sleep and nothing
to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still we could not realize what she said, for we had never seen a
beggar. But from that time it began to dawn upon us that all the
world was not a plantation, with more than enough on it for people
to eat. And when we were old enough to read and compare our
surroundings with what we learned about other countries, we found
that our laboring population was more bountifully supplied than that
of any other land. We read about &ldquo;myriads of poor, starving creatures,
with pinched faces and tattered garments,&rdquo; in far off cities and
countries. We read of hundreds who, from destitution and wretchedness,
committed suicide. We read these things, but could not fully
sympathise with such want and suffering; for it is necessary to witness
these in order to feel the fullest sympathy, and we had never
seen anything of the kind on our own or our neighbor&rsquo;s plantations.</p>

<p>Their religious instruction, I found, had not been more neglected
than among the lower classes in England, Ireland, France, Russia
and elsewhere. Every church&mdash;there was one of some denomination
near every plantation&mdash;had special seats reserved for the negroes.
The minister always addressed a portion of his sermon particularly
to them, and held service for them exclusively on Sabbath afternoon.
Besides, they had their own ministers among themselves, and had
night prayer meetings in their cabins whenever they chose.</p>

<p>Many prayers ascended from earnest hearts for their conversion,
and I knew no home at which some effort was not made for their
religious instruction.</p>

<p>One of our friends&mdash;a Presbyterian minister and earnest Christian&mdash;devoted
the greater part of his time to preaching and teaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
them. And many pious ministers, throughout the State, bestowed
upon them time and labor.</p>

<p>I once attended a gay party where the young lady of the house&mdash;the
center of attraction&mdash;hearing that one of the negroes was suddenly
very ill, excused herself from the company, carried her Prayer-book
to the cabin, and passed the night by the bedside of the sick
man, reading and repeating verses to him. I have also had young
lady friends who declined attending a wedding or party when a favorite
servant was ill.</p>

<p>On one occasion an English gentleman&mdash;Surgeon in the Royal
Artillery&mdash;visiting at our house, accompanied us to a wedding and
hearing that two young ladies had not attended on account of the
illness of a negro servant, said to me: &ldquo;This would not have been
in England, and will scarcely be believed when I tell it on my return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The same gentleman expressed astonishment at one of our neighbor&rsquo;s
sitting up all night to nurse one of his negroes who was ill.
He was amused at the manner of our servants&rsquo; identifying themselves
with the master and his possessions, always speaking of &ldquo;our
horses,&rdquo; &ldquo;our cows,&rdquo; &ldquo;our crop,&rdquo; &ldquo;our mill,&rdquo; &ldquo;our blacksmith&rsquo;s shop,&rdquo;
&ldquo;our carriage,&rdquo; &ldquo;our black folks,&rdquo; &amp;c. He told us he observed also
a difference between our menials and those of his own country, in
that, while here they were individualized, there they were known by
the names of &ldquo;Boots,&rdquo; &ldquo;&rsquo;Ostler,&rdquo; &ldquo;Driver,&rdquo; &ldquo;Footman,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cook,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Waiter,&rdquo; &ldquo;Scullion,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>

<p>On our plantations the most insignificant stable boy felt himself
of some importance.</p>

<p>When I heard Mr. Dickens read scenes from Nicholas Nickleby,
the tone of voice in which he personated Smike sent a chill through
me, for I had never before heard the human voice express such hopeless
despair. Can there be in England, thought I, human beings
afraid of the sound of their own voices?</p>

<p>There was a class of men in our State who made a business of
buying negroes to sell again farther south. These we never met,
and held in horror. But even they, when we reflect, could not have
treated them with inhumanity; for what man would pay a thousand
dollars for a piece of property, and fail to take the best possible care
of it? The &ldquo;traders&rdquo; usually bought their negroes when an estate
became involved, for the owners could not be induced to part with
their negroes until the last extremity&mdash;when everything else had
been seized by their creditors. Houses, lands, everything went first,
before giving up the negroes; the owner preferring to impoverish
himself in the effort to keep and provide for these&mdash;which was unwise,
financially, and would not have been thought of by a mercenary
people.</p>

<p>But it was hard to part with one&rsquo;s &ldquo;own people,&rdquo; and see them
scattered. Still our debts had to be paid; often security debts after
the death of the owner, when all had to be sold. And who of us but
can remember the tears of anguish caused by this, and scenes of
sorrow to which we can never revert without the keenest grief?
Yet, like all events in this chequered human life, even these sometimes
turned out best for the negroes, when by this means they ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>changed
unpleasant for more agreeable homes. Still it appeared to
me a great evil, and often did I pray that God would make us a way
of escape from it. But His ways are past finding out, and why He
had been pleased to order it thus we shall never know.</p>

<p>Instances of harsh or cruel treatment were rare. I never heard of
more than two or three individuals who were &ldquo;hard&rdquo; or unkind to
their negroes, and these were ostracised from respectable society,
their very names bringing reproach and blight upon their descendants.</p>

<p>We knew of but one instance of cruelty on our plantation, and
that was when &ldquo;Uncle Joe,&rdquo; the blacksmith, burnt his nephew&rsquo;s face
with a hot iron. The man carries the scar to this day, and in speaking
of it, always says: &ldquo;Soon as my master found out how Uncle
Joe treated me he wouldn&rsquo;t let me work no more in his shop.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p>The extent of these estates precluding the possibility of near neighbors,
their isolation would have been intolerable but for the custom
of visiting which prevailed among us. Many houses were filled
with visitors the greater part of the year, usually remaining two or
three weeks. Visiting tours were made in our private carriages&mdash;each
family making at least one such tour a year. Nor was it necessary
to announce these visits by message or letter, each house being
considered always ready, and &ldquo;entertaining company&rdquo; the occupation
of the people. Sometimes two or three carriages might be descried
in the evening coming up to the door through the Lombardy poplar
avenue&mdash;the usual approach to many old houses&mdash;whereupon ensued
a lively flutter among small servants, who speedily got them into
their clean aprons, and ran to open gates, and remove parcels from
carriages, and becoming generally excited. Lady visitors were always
accompanied by colored maids, although sure of finding a superfluity
of these at each establishment. The mistress of the house always
received her guests in the front porch, with a sincere and cordial
greeting.</p>

<p>These visiting friends at my own home made an impression upon
me that no time can efface. I almost see them now&mdash;those dear,
gentle faces&mdash;my mother&rsquo;s early friends; and those delightful old
ladies in close bordered tarletan caps, who used to come to see my
grandmother. These last would sit round the fire knitting and talking
over their early memories; how they remembered the red coats
of the British; how they had seen the Richmond theater burn down,
with some of their family burned in it. How they used to wear such
beautiful turbans of <i>crepe lise</i> to the Cartersville balls, and how they
used to dance the minuet. At mention of this, my grandmother
would lay off her spectacles, put aside her knitting, rise with dignity&mdash;she
was very tall&mdash;and show us the step of the minuet, gliding
slowly and majestically around the room. Then she would say:
&ldquo;Ah, children, you will never see anything so graceful as the minuet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Such jumping around as <i>you</i> see would not have been considered
&lsquo;genteel&rsquo; in <i>my</i> day!&rdquo;</p>

<p>My mother&rsquo;s friends belonged to a later generation, and were types
of women, whom to have known I shall ever consider a blessing and
privilege. They combined intelligence with exquisite refinement and
agreeability; and their annual visits gave my mother the greatest
happiness, which we soon learned to share and appreciate.</p>

<p>As I consider these ladies models for our sex through all time, I
enumerate some of their attractions:</p>

<p>Entire absence of pretense made them always agreeable. Having
no &ldquo;parlor&rdquo; or &ldquo;company&rdquo; manners to assume, they preserved at all
times a gentle, natural, easy demeanor and conversation. They had
not dipped into the sciences, attempted by some of our sex at the
present day; but the study of Latin and French, with general reading
in their mother tongue rendered them intelligent companions for
cultivated men. They also possessed the rare gift of reading well
aloud, and wrote letters unsurpassed in penmanship, ease and agreeability
of style.</p>

<p>Italian and German professors being rare in that day, their musical
acquirements did not extend beyond the simplest piano accompaniments
to old English and Scotch airs, which they sang in a sweet,
natural voice, and which so enchanted the beaux of their time that
they&mdash;the beaux&mdash;never afterwards became reconciled to any higher
order of music.</p>

<p>These model women also managed their household affairs admirably;
and were uniformly kind, but never familiar with their servants.
They kept ever before them the Bible as their constant guide
and rule in life, and were surely, as nearly as possible, holy in
thought, word and deed. I have looked in vain for <i>exactly such</i> women
in other lands, but have failed to find them.</p>

<p>Then there were old gentlemen visitors&mdash;beaux of my grandmother&rsquo;s
day&mdash;still wearing cues, wide ruffled bosoms, short pants and
knee buckles. These pronounced the <i>a</i> very broad; sat a long time
over their wine at dinner, and carried in their pockets gold or silver
snuff-boxes presented by some distinguished individual at some remote
period.</p>

<p>Our visiting acquaintance extended from Botetourt county to Richmond,
and among them were jolly old Virginia gentlemen and precise
old Virginia gentlemen; eccentric old Virginia gentlemen and
prosy old Virginia gentlemen; courtly old Virginia gentlemen and
plain-mannered old Virginia gentlemen; charming old Virginia gentlemen
and uninteresting old Virginia gentlemen. Many of them
had graduated years and years ago at William and Mary College.</p>

<p>Then we had another set, of a later day&mdash;those who graduated in
the first graduating class at the University of Virginia, when that institution
was first established. These happened&mdash;all that we knew&mdash;to
have belonged to the same class, and often amused us&mdash;without
intending it&mdash;by reverting to that fact in these words:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>That</i> was a remarkable class! Every man in that class made his
mark in law, letters or politics! Let me see: There was Toombs.
There was Charles Mosby. There was Alexander Stuart. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
was Burwell. There was R. M. T. Hunter;&rdquo; and so on, calling each
by name except himself, knowing that the others never failed to do
that!</p>

<p>Edgar Poe and Alexander Stephens, of Georgia, were also at the
University with these gentlemen.</p>

<p>Although presenting an infinite variety of mind, manner and temperament,
all the gentlemen who visited us, young and old, possessed
in common certain characteristics; one of which was a deference to
ladies, which made us feel that we had been put in the world especially
to be waited upon by them. Their standard for woman was
high. They seemed to regard her as some rare and costly statue set
in a niche to be admired and <i>never taken</i> down.</p>

<p>Another peculiarity they had in common, was a habit&mdash;which
seemed irresistible&mdash;of tracing people back to the remotest generation,
and appearing inconsolable if ever they failed to find out the
pedigree of any given individual for at least four generations. This,
however, was an innocent pastime, from which they seemed to derive
much pleasure and satisfaction, and which should not be regarded,
even in this advanced age, a serious fault.</p>

<p>Among our various visitors, was a kinsman&mdash;of whom I often
heard, but do not recollect&mdash;a bachelor of eighty years, always accompanied
by his negro servant as old as himself. Both had the
same name, Louis,&mdash;pronounced like the French&mdash;and this aged pair
had been so long together they could not exist apart. Black Louis
rarely left his master&rsquo;s side; assisting in the conversation if his master
became perplexed or forgetful. When his master talked in the
parlor, black Louis always planted his chair in the middle of the door-sill,
every now and then correcting or reminding with: &ldquo;Now, master,
dat warnt Col. Taylor&rsquo;s horse dat won dat race dat day. You
and me was thar.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;Now, master you done forgot all &rsquo;bout dat.
Dat was in de year 1779, and <i>dis</i> is de way it happened,&rdquo; &amp;c., much
to the amusement of the company assembled. All this was said, I
am told, most respectfully, although the old negro in a manner <i>possessed</i>
his master, having entire charge and command of him.</p>

<p>The negroes often felt great pride in &ldquo;<i>their</i> white people,&rdquo; as they
called their owners, and loved to brag about what &ldquo;<i>their</i> white people&rdquo;
did and what &ldquo;<i>their</i> white people&rdquo; had.</p>

<p>On one occasion it became necessary for my sister and myself to
ride a short distance in a public conveyance. A small colored boy,
who helped in our dining-room, had to get in the same stage. Two
old gentlemen&mdash;strangers to us&mdash;sitting opposite, supposing we had
fallen asleep, when we closed our eyes to keep out the dust, commenced
talking about us. Said one to the other: &ldquo;Now those children
will spoil their Sunday bonnets.&rdquo; Whereupon our colored boy
spoke up quickly: &ldquo;Umph! <i>you</i> think <i>them&rsquo;s</i> my mistesses&rsquo; Sunday
bonnets? Umph! you <i>jes ought</i> to see what they got up thar on top
the stage in thar band box!&rdquo; At this we both laughed, for the boy
had never seen our &ldquo;Sunday bonnets,&rdquo; nor did he know that we possessed
any.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p>English books never fail to make honorable mention of a &ldquo;roast
of beef,&rdquo; &ldquo;a leg of mutton,&rdquo; &ldquo;a dish of potatoes,&rdquo; &ldquo;a dish of tea,&rdquo; &amp;c.,
while with us the abundance of such things gave them, we thought,
not enough importance to be particularized. Still my reminiscences
extend to these.</p>

<p>Every Virginia housewife knew how to compound all the various
dishes in Mrs. Randolph&rsquo;s Cookery book, and our tables were filled
with every species of meat and vegetable to be found on a plantation;
with every kind of cakes, jellies and blanc-mange to be concocted
out of eggs, butter and cream, besides an endless catalogue
of preserves, sweet meats, pickles and condiments. So that in the
matter of good living, both in abundance and the manner of serving,
a Virginia plantation could not be excelled.</p>

<p>The first speciality being good loaf bread, there was always a hot
loaf for breakfast, hot corn bread for dinner and a hot loaf for supper.
Every house was famed for its loaf bread, and, said a gentleman
once to me: &ldquo;Although at each place it is superb, yet each loaf
differs from another loaf, preserving distinct characteristics which
would enable me to distinguish, instantly, should there be a convention
of loaves, the Oaklands loaf from the Greenfield loaf, and the
Avenel loaf from the Rustic Lodge loaf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And apropos of this gentleman, whom, it is needless to add, was a
celebrated connoisseur in this matter of loaf bread, it was a noticeable
fact with our cook, that whenever he came to our house the bread
in trying to do its best always did its worst!</p>

<p>Speaking of bread, another gentleman expressed his belief that at
the last great day, it will be found that more housewives will be punished
on account of light bread than anything else; for he knew some
who were never out of temper except when the light bread failed!</p>

<p>Time would fail me to dwell, as I should, upon the incomparable
rice waffles, and beat biscuit, and muffins, and laplands, and Marguerites,
and flannel cakes, and French rolls, and velvet rolls, and
ladies-fingers constantly brought by relays of small servants, during
breakfast, hot and hotter from the kitchen. Then the tea waiters
handed at night, with the beef tongue, the sliced ham, the grated
cheese, the cold turkey, the dried venison, the loaf bread buttered
hot, the batter-cakes, crackers, the quince marmalade, the wafers all
pass in review before me.</p>

<p>The first time I ever heard of a manner of living different from
this, was when it became important for my mother to make a visit
to a great aunt in Baltimore, and she went for the first time out of
her native State&mdash;neither herself nor her mother had ever been out of
Virginia. My mother was accompanied by her maid, Kitty, on this
expedition, and when they returned both had many astounding things
to relate. My grandmother threw up her hands in amazement on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
hearing that some of the first ladies in the city, who visited old aunt,
confined the conversation of a morning call to the subject of the
faults of their hired servants. &ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo; exclaimed the old
lady. &ldquo;I never considered it well bred to mention servants or their
faults in company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed, in our part of the world, a mistress became offended if the
faults of her servants were alluded to, just as persons become displeased
when the faults of their children are discussed.</p>

<p>Maid Kitty&rsquo;s account of this visit, I will give as well as I can remember
in her own words, as she described it to her fellow-servants:
&ldquo;You never see sich a way for people to live! Folks goes to bed in
Baltimore &rsquo;thout a single mouthful in thar house to eat. And they
can&rsquo;t get nothin&rsquo; neither &rsquo;thout they gits up soon in the mornin&rsquo; and
goes to the market after it themselves. Rain, hail or shine, they got
to go. &rsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t suit <i>our</i> white folks to live that way! And I
wouldn&rsquo;t live thar not for nothin&rsquo; in this world. In that fine three
story house thar ain&rsquo;t but bare two servants, an&rsquo; they has to do all
the work. &rsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t suit <i>me</i>, an&rsquo; I wouldn&rsquo;t live thar not for nothin&rsquo;
in this whole creation. I would git <i>that</i> lonesome I couldn&rsquo;t stan&rsquo; it.
Bare two servants! and they calls themselves rich, too! And they
cooks in the cellar. I know mistess couldn&rsquo;t stand that&mdash;smellin&rsquo;
everything out the kitchen all over the house. Umph! <i>them</i> folks
don&rsquo;t know nothin&rsquo; <i>tall</i> &rsquo;bout good livin&rsquo;, with thar cold bread and thar
rusks!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maid Kitty spoke truly when she said she had never seen two women
do all the housework. For, at home, often three women would
clean up one chamber. One made the bed, while another swept the
floor and a third dusted and put the chairs straight. Labor was divided
and subdivided; and I remember one woman whose sole employment
seemed to be throwing open the blinds in the morning and
rubbing the posts of my grandmother&rsquo;s high bedstead. This rubbing
business was carried quite to excess. Every inch of mahogany was
waxed and rubbed to the highest state of polish, as were also the
floors, the brass fenders, irons and candlesticks.</p>

<p>When I reflect upon the degree of comfort arrived at in our homes,
I think we should have felt grateful to our ancestors; for as Quincy
has written: &ldquo;In whatever mode of existence man finds himself, be
it savage or civilized, he perceives that he is indebted for the greater
part of his possessions to events over which he had no control; to
individuals whose names, perhaps, never reached his ear; to sacrifices
which he never shared. How few of all these blessings do we
owe to our own power or prudence! How few on which we can not
discern the impress of a long past generation!&rdquo; So we were indebted
for our agreeable surroundings to the heroism and sacrifices of past
generations, and not to venerate and eulogize them betrays the want
of a truly noble soul. For what courage; what patience; what perseverence;
what long suffering; what Christian forbearance, must it
have cost our great grandmothers to civilize, Christianize and elevate
the naked, savage Africans to the condition of good cooks and
respectable maids! They&mdash;our great grandmothers&mdash;did not enjoy
the blessed privilege even of turning their servants off when ineff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>ient
or disagreeable, but had to keep them through life. The only
thing was to bear and forbear, and</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;be to their virtues very kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To their faults,&rdquo; a great deal &ldquo;blind.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>If in Heaven there be one seat higher than another, it must be reserved
for those true Southern matrons, who performed conscientiously
their part assigned them by God&mdash;civilizing and instructing
this race.</p>

<p>To the children of Israel God said: &ldquo;I will give thee the heathen
for an inheritance.&rdquo; So He had given <i>us</i> &ldquo;the heathen for an inheritance,&rdquo;
and however bitterly some of us deplored it&mdash;as we did&mdash;we
should have remembered that nothing happens by chance; but that
God disposes all events for some purpose of his own. We were instruments
in His hand, and if we or our forefathers were chosen by
Him to elevate a race in the scale of comfort and intelligence we
should not deplore it, but pray that what we have done for them may
be a lasting benefit and that God&rsquo;s blessing may follow them in another
condition of life.</p>

<p>However we may differ in the opinion, there is no greater compliment
to Southern slave owners than the idea prevailing in many
places that the negro is already sufficiently elevated to hold the highest
positions in the gift of our Government.</p>

<p>I once met in traveling an English gentleman, who asked me:
&ldquo;How can you bear those miserable black negroes about your houses
and about your persons? To me they are horribly repulsive, and I
would not endure one about me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither would they have been my choice,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;But God
sent them to us. I was born to this inheritance and could not avert
it. What would <i>you</i> English have done,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;if God had sent
them to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thrown them into the bottom of the sea!&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the poor negro this sentiment had not prevailed
among us. I believe God endowed our people with qualities peculiarly
adapted to taking charge of this race and that no other nation
could have kept them. Our people did not demand as much work as
in other countries is required of servants; and I think had more affection
for them than is elsewhere felt for menials.</p>

<p>In this connection, I remember an incident during the war which
deserves to be recorded as showing the affection entertained for negro
dependents:</p>

<p>When our soldiers were nearly starved, and only allowed daily a
small handfull of parched corn, the Colonel of a Virginia regiment,
by accident got some coffee, a small portion of which was daily distributed
to each man. In the regiment was a cousin of mine&mdash;a
young man endowed with the noblest attributes God can give&mdash;who,
although famishing and needing it, denied himself his portion every
day that he might bring it to his black mammy. He made a small
bag in which he deposited and carefully saved it.</p>

<p>When he arrived at home on furlough, his mother wept to see his
tattered clothes, his shoeless feet and starved appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon producing the little bag of coffee, with a cheerful smile he
said: &ldquo;See what I&rsquo;ve saved to bring black mammy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! my son,&rdquo; said his mother, &ldquo;you have needed it yourself.
Why did you not use it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;it has been so long since you all had any coffee,
and I made out very well on water, when I thought how black
mammy missed her coffee, and how glad she would be to get it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The antiquity of the furniture in our homes can scarcely be described&mdash;every
article appearing to have been purchased during the
reign of George III., since which period no new fixtures or household
utensils seemed to have been bought.</p>

<p>The books in our libraries had been brought from England almost
two hundred years before. In our own library there were Hogarth&rsquo;s
pictures, in old worm-eaten frames; and among the literary curiosities,
one of the earliest editions of Shakespeare&mdash;1685&mdash;containing
under the author&rsquo;s picture the lines by Ben Johnson:</p>

<p>This was a reprint of the first edition of Shakespeare&rsquo;s works collected
by John Heminge and Henry Condell, two of his friends in
the company of comedians.</p>

<p>The perusal of the Arabian Nights, when a small child, possessed
me with the idea that their dazzling pictures were to be realized when
we emerged from plantation life into the outside world, and the disappointment
at not finding Richmond paved with gems and gold
like those cities in Eastern story, is remembered to the present time.</p>

<p>Brought up amid antiquities, the Virginia girl disturbed herself not
about modern fashions, appearing happy in her mother&rsquo;s old silks
and satins made over; her grandmother&rsquo;s laces and brooch of untold
dimensions, with a weeping willow and tombstone on it&mdash;a constant
reminder of the past&mdash;which had descended from some remote ancestor.</p>

<p>She slept in a high bedstead&mdash;the bed of her ancestors; washed
her face on an old fashioned, spindle-legged washstand; mounted a
high chair to arrange her hair before the old fashioned mirror on the
high bureau; climbed to the top of a high mantle-piece to take down
the old fashioned high candlesticks; climbed a pair of steps to get
into the high-swung, old fashioned carriage; perched her feet upon
the top of a high brass fender if she wanted to get them warm; and,
in short, had to perform so many gymnastics that she felt convinced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
her ancestors must have been a race of giants, or they could not have
required such tall and inaccessible furniture.</p>

<p>An occasional visit to Richmond or Petersburg, sometimes animated
her with a desire for some style of dress less antique than her
own; although she had as much admiration and attention as if she
had just received her wardrobe from Paris.</p>

<p>Her social outlook might have been considered limited and circumscribed&mdash;her
parents being unwilling that her acquaintance should
extend beyond the descendants of their own old friends.</p>

<p>She had never any occasion to make what the world calls a
&ldquo;debut;&rdquo; the constant flow of company at her father&rsquo;s house having
rendered her assistance necessary in entertaining guests, as soon as
she could converse and be companionable. So that her manners
were early formed, and she remembered not the time when it was
anything but very easy and agreeable, to be in the society of ladies
and gentlemen.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In due time we were provided&mdash;my sister and myself&mdash;with the best
instructors&mdash;a lady all the way from Bordeaux to teach French, and
a German Professor for German and music. The latter opened to
us a new world of music. He was a fine linguist, thorough musician
and perfect gentleman. He lived with us five years, and remained
our sincere and truly valued friend through life.</p>

<p>After some years we were thought to have arrived at &ldquo;sufficient
age of discretion&rdquo; for a trip to New York city.</p>

<p>Fancy our feelings on arriving in that world of modern people and
modern things! Fancy two young girls suddenly transported from
the time of George III. to the largest hotel on Broadway in 1855!</p>

<p>All was as strange to us then as we are now to the Chinese.
Never had we seen white servants before; and on being attended by
them at first felt a sort of embarrassment, but soon found they were
accustomed to less consideration and more hard work than were our
negro servants at home.</p>

<p>Everything and everybody seemed in a mad whirl&mdash;the &ldquo;march of
material progress,&rdquo; they told us. It seemed to us more the &ldquo;perpetual
motion of progress.&rdquo; Everybody said that if &ldquo;old fogy&rdquo; Virginia
did not make haste to join this &ldquo;march,&rdquo; she would be left a
&ldquo;wreck behind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We found ourselves in the &ldquo;advanced age;&rdquo; the land of water-pipes
and dumb-waiters; the land of enterprise and money, and at
the same time an economy amounting to parsimony.</p>

<p>The manners of the people were strange to us, and different from
ours. The ladies seemed to have gone ahead of the men in the
&ldquo;march of progress&rdquo;&mdash;their manner being more pronounced. They
did not hesitate to &ldquo;push about&rdquo; through crowds and public places.</p>

<p>Still, we were young; and dazzled with the gloss and glitter, we
wondered why old Virginia couldn&rsquo;t join this &ldquo;march of progress,&rdquo;
and have dumb-waiters, and elevators, and water-pipes, and gas fixtures,
and baby jumpers, and washing machines.</p>

<p>We asked a gentleman who was with us, why old Virginia had not
all these, and he replied: &ldquo;Because, while the people here have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
busy working for themselves, old fogy Virginia has been working for
negroes. All the money Virginia makes is spent in feeding and
clothing negroes. And,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;these people in the North
were shrewd enough years ago to sell all their&rsquo;s to the South.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All was strange to us; even the table-cloths on the tea and breakfast
tables instead of napkins under the plates as we had at home,
and which always looked so pretty on the mahogany.</p>

<p>But the novelty having worn off after awhile, we found out there
was a good deal of &ldquo;imitation,&rdquo; after all, mixed up in everything.
Things did not seem to have been &ldquo;fixed up&rdquo; to last as long as our old
things at home, and we began to wonder if the &ldquo;advanced age&rdquo; really
made the people any better, or more agreeable, or more hospitable,
or more generous, or more brave, or more self-reliant, or more charitable,
or more true, or more pious, than in &ldquo;old fogy Virginia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was one thing most curious to us in New York. No one
seemed to do anything by himself or herself. No one had an individuality;
all existed in &ldquo;clubs&rdquo; or &ldquo;societies.&rdquo; They had also many
&ldquo;isms&rdquo; of which we had never heard; some of the people sitting up
all night, and going around all day talking about &ldquo;manifestations,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;spirits,&rdquo; and &ldquo;affinities,&rdquo; which they told us was &ldquo;spiritualism.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this impressed us slow, old fashioned Virginians, as a strangely
up-side-down, wrong-side-out condition of things.</p>

<p>Much of the conversation we heard was confined to asking questions
of strangers, and discussing the best means of making money.</p>

<p>We were surprised too to hear of &ldquo;plantation customs&rdquo; said to exist
among us which were entirely new to us; and one of the Magazines
published in the city informed us that &ldquo;dipping&rdquo; was one of the
&ldquo;characteristics&rdquo; of Southern women. What could the word &ldquo;dipping&rdquo;
mean? we wondered, for we had never heard it before. Upon
inquiry we found that it meant &ldquo;rubbing the teeth with snuff on a
small stick&rdquo;&mdash;a truly disgusting habit which could not have prevailed
in Virginia, or we would have had some tradition of it at least&mdash;our
acquaintance extending over the State, and our ancestors having
settled there two hundred years ago.</p>

<p>A young gentleman from Virginia&mdash;bright and overflowing with
fun, also visiting New York&mdash;coming into the parlor one day threw
himself on a sofa in a violent fit of laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; we asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am laughing,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;at the absurd questions these people
can ask. What do you think? A man asked me just now if we
didn&rsquo;t keep blood-hounds in Virginia to chase negroes! I told him,
O, yes, every plantation keeps several dozen! And we often have
a tender boiled negro infant for breakfast!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how could you have told such a story?&rdquo; we said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you know we never saw a blood-hound in Virginia,
and I do not expect there is one in the State; but these people
delight in believing everything horrible about us, and I thought I
might as well gratify them with something marvelous. So the next
book published up here will have, I&rsquo;ve no doubt, a chapter headed:
&lsquo;Blood-hounds in Virginia and boiled negroes for breakfast!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>While we were purchasing some trifles to bring home to some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
our servants, a lady, who had entertained us most kindly at her house
on Fifth Avenue, expressing surprise, said: &ldquo;<i>We</i> never think of
bringing home presents to our &lsquo;helps.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was the first time we had ever heard, instead of &ldquo;servant,&rdquo;
the word &ldquo;help,&rdquo; which seemed then&mdash;and still seems&mdash;misapplied.
The dictionaries define &ldquo;help&rdquo; to mean aid; assistance; remedy,
while &ldquo;servant&rdquo; means one who attends another, and acts at his
command. When a man pays another to &ldquo;help&rdquo; him, it implies he
is to do part of the work himself, and is dishonest if he leaves the
whole to be performed by his &ldquo;help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The word servant is an honest Bible word, and distinctly defines
a position. Noah did not say: &ldquo;Cursed be Cain, a &lsquo;help&rsquo; of &lsquo;helps&rsquo;
shall he be to his brethren.&rdquo; Nor did Abraham call his eldest &ldquo;servant,&rdquo;
although ruling over all he had, his &ldquo;help.&rdquo; Neither does the
Commandment say thy &ldquo;man-help&rdquo; or thy &ldquo;maid-help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The word &ldquo;servant&rdquo; seems, after the lapse of centuries, still applied
with the same meaning by St. Paul, who does not say, &ldquo;Master,
give unto your &lsquo;helps&rsquo; that which is equal;&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Let as many
&lsquo;helps&rsquo; as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all
honor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words &ldquo;master and servant&rdquo; thus lose their true significance.</p>

<p>Among other discoveries during this visit we found how much more
talent it requires to entertain company in the country than the city.
In the latter the guests and family form no &ldquo;social circle round the
blazing hearth&rdquo; at night, but disperse far and wide, to be entertained
at the concert, the opera, the theater or club; while in the country
one depends entirely upon native intellect and conversational talent.</p>

<p>And oh! the memory of our own fireside circles! The exquisite
women; the men of giant intellect, eloquence and wit at sundry
times assembled there! Could our andirons but utter speech what
could they not tell of mirth and song, eloquence and wit, whose flow
made many an evening bright.</p>

<p>Well, as all delights must have an end, the time came for us to
leave these &ldquo;scenes enchanting.&rdquo; Bidding adieu forever to the land
of &ldquo;modern appliances&rdquo; and stale bread, we returned to the land flowing
with &ldquo;old ham and corn cakes,&rdquo; and were soon surrounded by
friends who came to hear the marvels we had to relate.</p>

<p>How monotonous, how dull, prosy, inconvenient everything seemed
after our plunge into modern life!</p>

<p>We told old Virginia about all the enterprise we had seen; and
how she was left far behind everybody and everything, urging her to
join at once the &ldquo;march of material progress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the mother of States persisted in sitting contentedly over her
old fashioned wood fire with brass andirons, and while thus musing
these words fell slowly and distinctly from her lips:</p>

<p>&ldquo;They call me &lsquo;old fogy,&rsquo; and tell me I must get out of my old ruts
and come into the &lsquo;advanced age.&rsquo; But I don&rsquo;t care about their &lsquo;advanced
age;&rsquo; their water-pipes and elevators. Give me the right sort
of men and women! God loving; God serving men and women.
Men brave, courteous, true. Women sensible, gentle and retiring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have not my &lsquo;plantation homes&rsquo; furnished warriors, statesmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
and orators, acknowledged great by the world? I make it a rule to
&lsquo;keep on hand&rsquo; men equal to emergencies. Had I not Washington,
Patrick Henry, Light-horse Harry Lee, and others, ready for the first
Revolution; and if there comes another&mdash;which God forbid!&mdash;have I
not plenty more just like them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here she laughed with delight, as she called over their names:
&ldquo;Robert Lee, Jackson, Joe Johnstone, Stuart, Early, Floyd, Preston,
the Breckinridges, Scott, and others like them, brave and true as
steel. Ha! ha! I know of what stuff to make men! And if my old
&lsquo;ruts and grooves&rsquo; produce men like these, should they be abandoned?
Can any &lsquo;advanced age&rsquo; produce better?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there are my soldiers of the cross. Do I not yearly send
out a faithful band to be a &lsquo;shining light,&rsquo; and spread the gospel
North, South, East, West, even into foreign lands? Is not the only
Christian paper in Athens, Greece, the result of the love and labor
of one of my<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> soldiers?</p>

<p>&ldquo;And can I not send out men of science, as well as warriors, statesmen
and orators? There is Maury on the seas showing the world
what a man of science can do. If my &lsquo;old fogy&rsquo; system has produced
men like these must it be abandoned?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the old mother of States settled herself back in her chair, a
smile of satisfaction resting on her face, and she ceased to think of
<i>change</i>.</p>

<p>Telling our mother of all the wonders and pleasures of New York,
she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were so delighted, I expect you would like to sell out everything
here and move there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be delightful!&rdquo; we exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you would miss many pleasures you have in our present
home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We would have no time to miss anything,&rdquo; said my sister, &ldquo;in
that whirl of excitement!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;I believe one might as well try to move the
Rocky Mountains to Fifth Avenue, as an old Virginian! They have
such a horror of selling out and moving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not so easy to sell out and move,&rdquo; replied our mother, &ldquo;when
you remember all the negroes we have to take care of and support.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the negroes,&rdquo; we said, &ldquo;are the weight continually pulling
us down! Will the time <i>ever</i> come for us to be free of them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were placed here,&rdquo; replied our mother, &ldquo;by God, for us to
take care of, and it does not seem that we can change it. When we
emancipate them, it does not better their condition. Those left free
and with good farms given them by their masters, soon sink into
poverty and wretchedness, and become a nuisance to the community.
We see how miserable are Mr. Randolph&rsquo;s<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> negroes, who with their
freedom received from their master a large body of the best land in
Prince Edward county. My own grandfather also emancipated a
large number, having first had them taught lucrative trades that they
might support themselves, and giving them money and land. But
they were not prosperous or happy. We have also tried sending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
them to Liberia. You know my old friend, Mrs. L&mdash;&mdash;, emancipated
all her&rsquo;s and sent them to Liberia, but she told me the other day she
was convinced it had been no kindness to them, for she continually
receives letters begging assistance, and yearly supplies them with
clothes and money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So it seemed our way was &ldquo;hedged about&rdquo; and surrounded by
walls of circumstances too thick and solid to be pulled down, and
we said no more.</p>

<p>But some weeks after this conversation, we had a visit from a
friend&mdash;&ldquo;Mozis Addums&rdquo;&mdash;who having lived in New York and hearing
us express a wish to live there, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! exchange a home in old Virginia for one on Fifth Avenue?
You don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about! They are not even
called &lsquo;homes&rsquo; there, but &lsquo;<i>house</i>;&rsquo; where they turn into bed at midnight;
eat stale-bread breakfasts; have brilliant parties&mdash;where
several thousand people meet who don&rsquo;t care anything about each
other. They have no soul life; but shut themselves up in themselves,
live for themselves, and never have any social enjoyment like ours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; we said, &ldquo;could not our friends come to see us there as well
as anywhere else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No indeed!&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Your hearts would soon be as cold
and dead as your marble door-fronts. You wouldn&rsquo;t want to see
anybody, and nobody would want to see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are complimentary, certainly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know all about it; and,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I know you could not
find on Fifth Avenue such women as your mother and grandmother,
who never think of themselves, but are constantly planning and providing
for others, making their homes comfortable and pleasant, and
attending to the wants and welfare of so many negroes. And that
is what the women all over the South are doing and what the New
York women cannot comprehend. How can anybody know, except
ourselves, the personal sacrifices of our women?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said my sister, &ldquo;you need not be so severe and eloquent
because we thought we would like to live in New York! If we
should sell all we possess, we could never afford to live there. Besides,
you know our mother would as soon think of selling her children
as her servants&mdash;who indeed are beginning to possess <i>her</i>, instead
of her possessing them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help talking, for I hear our people
abused, and called indolent and self-indulgent, when I know they
have valor and endurance enough. And I believe so much &lsquo;material
progress&rsquo; leaves no leisure for the highest development of heart and
mind. Where the whole energy of a people is applied to making
money, the souls of men become dwarfed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do not feel,&rdquo; we said, &ldquo;like abusing Northern people, in
whose thrift and enterprise we found much to admire; and especially
the self-reliance of their women, enabling them to take care of themselves
and travel from Maine to the Gulf without an escort, while we
find it impossible to travel a day&rsquo;s journey without a special protector.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That is just what I don&rsquo;t like,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to see a woman in a
crowd of strangers needing no &lsquo;special protector.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This dependence upon your sex,&rdquo; we replied, &ldquo;keeps you so vain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We would lose our gallantry altogether,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if we found
you could get along without us.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p>After some months&mdash;ceasing to think and speak of New York&mdash;our
lives glided back into the old channel, where the placid stream
of life had many isles of simple pleasures.</p>

<p>We were, in those days, not &ldquo;whirled with glowing wheel over the
iron track in a crowded car,&rdquo; with dirty, shrieking children and repulsive-looking
people&mdash;on their way to the small pox hospital, for
all we knew. We were not jammed against rough, dreadful-looking
people, eating dreadful smelling things, out of dreadful-looking
baskets and satchels, and throwing the remains of dreadful pies and
sausages over the cushioned seats.</p>

<p>Oh, no! our journeys were performed in venerable carriages, and
our lunch was enjoyed by some cool, shady spring where we stopped
in some shady forest at midday.</p>

<p>Our own venerable carriage, my sister styled, &ldquo;The old ship of
Zion,&rdquo; saying, &ldquo;It had carried many thousands, and was likely to
carry many more.&rdquo; And our driver we called the &ldquo;Ancient Mariner.&rdquo;
He presided on his seat&mdash;a high perch&mdash;in a very high hat
and with great dignity. Having been driving the same carriage for
nearly forty years&mdash;no driver being thought safe who had not been
on the carriage box at least twenty years&mdash;considered himself an
oracle, and in consequence of his years and experience kept us in
much awe&mdash;my sister and myself never daring to ask him to quicken
or retard his pace or change the direction of the road, however much
we desired it. We will ever remember this thraldom, and how we
often wished one of the younger negroes could be allowed to take his
place, but my grandmother said &ldquo;it would wound his feelings, and
besides be very unsafe&rdquo; for us.</p>

<p>At every steep hill or bad place in the road it was an established
custom to stop the carriage, unfold the high steps and &ldquo;let us out&rdquo;&mdash;like
pictures of the animals coming down out of the ark! This custom
had always prevailed in my mother&rsquo;s family, and there was a
tradition that my great grandfather&rsquo;s horses being habituated to stop
for this purpose, refused to pull up certain hills&mdash;even when the carriage
was empty&mdash;until the driver had dismounted and slammed the
door, after which they moved off without further hesitation.</p>

<p>This custom of walking at intervals made an agreeable variety,
and gave us an opportunity to enjoy fully the beautiful and picturesque
scenery through which we were passing.</p>

<p>These were the days of leisure and pleasure for travelers; and
when we remember the charming summer jaunts annually made in
this way, we almost regret the &ldquo;steam horse,&rdquo; which takes us now
to the same places in a few hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>We had two dear friends&mdash;Mary and Alice&mdash;who with their old
carriages and drivers&mdash;the fac similes of our own&mdash;frequently accompanied
us in these expeditions; and no generals ever exercised more
entire command over their armies than did these three black coachmen
over us. I smile now to think of their ever being called our
&ldquo;slaves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet, although they had this &ldquo;domineering&rdquo; spirit, they felt at the
same time, a certain pride in us, too.</p>

<p>On one occasion, when we were traveling together, our friend
Alice concluded to dismount from her carriage and ride a few miles
with a gentleman of the party in a buggy. She had not gone far
before the alarm was given that the buggy horse was running away,
whereupon our black generalissimos instantly stopped the three carriages
and anxiously watched the result. Old Uncle Edmund&mdash;Alice&rsquo;s
coachman&mdash;stood up in his seat highly excited, and when his
young mistress, with admirable presence of mind, seized the reins
and stopped the horse, turning him into a by-road, shouted at the
top of his voice: &ldquo;Thar, now! I always knowed Miss Alice was a
young &rsquo;oman of the most amiable courage!&rdquo; and over this feat continued
to chuckle the rest of the day.</p>

<p>The end of these pleasant journeys always brought us to some old
plantation home, where we met a warm welcome not only from the
white family, but the servants who constituted part of the establishment.</p>

<p>One of the most charming to which we made a yearly visit was
Oaklands, a lovely spot embowered in vines and shade trees.</p>

<p>The attractions of this home and family brought so many visitors
every summer, it was necessary to erect cottages about the grounds,
although the house itself was quite large. And as the yard was
usually filled with persons strolling about, or reading, or playing
chess under the trees, it had every appearance&mdash;on first approach&mdash;of
a small watering place. The mistress of this establishment was
a woman of rare attraction&mdash;possessing all the gentleness of her sex
with attributes of greatness enough for a hero. Tall and handsome,
she looked a queen as she stood on the portico receiving her
guests, and by the first words of greeting, from her warm, true heart,
charmed even strangers. Nor in any department of life did she betray
qualities other than these.</p>

<p>Without the least &ldquo;variableness or shadow of turning,&rdquo; her excellencies
were a perfect continuity, and her deeds of charity a blessing
to all in need within her reach. No undertaking seemed too great
for her, and no details&mdash;affecting the comfort of her home, family,
friends or servants&mdash;too small for her supervision.</p>

<p>The church&mdash;a few miles distant, the object of her care and love&mdash;received
at her hands constant and valuable aid, and its minister
generally formed one of her family circle.</p>

<p>No wonder then that the home of such a woman should have been
a favorite resort with all who had the privilege of knowing her. And
no wonder that all who enjoyed her charming hospitality were spell-bound,
nor wished to leave the spot.</p>

<p>In addition to the qualities I have attempted to describe, this lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
inherited from her father&mdash;General B.&mdash;an executive talent which
enabled her to order and arrange perfectly her domestic affairs, so
that from the delicious viands upon her table to the highly polished
oak of the floors, all gave evidence of her superior management, and
the admirable training of her servants.</p>

<p>Nor were the hospitalities of this establishment dispensed to the
gay and great alone; but shared alike by the homeless, the friendless,
and many a weary heart found sympathy and shelter there.</p>

<p>Well! Oaklands was famous for many things: its fine light bread;
its cinnamon cakes; its beat biscuit; its fricasseed chicken; its butter
and cream; its wine sauces; its plum puddings; its fine horses;
its beautiful meadows; its sloping green hills, and last, but not least,
its refined and agreeable society collected from every part of our
own State, and often from others.</p>

<p>For an epicure no better place could have been desired. And this
reminds me of a retired army officer&mdash;an epicure of the first water&mdash;we
often met there, whose sole occupation was visiting his friends,
and only subjects of conversation the best viands and the best manner
of cooking them! When asked whether he remembered certain agreeable
people at a certain place, he would reply: &ldquo;Yes, I dined there ten
years ago, and the turkey was very badly cooked&mdash;not quite done
enough!&rdquo; The turkey evidently having made a more lasting impression
than the people.</p>

<p>This gentleman lost an eye at the battle of Chapultepec, having
been among the first of our gallant men who scaled the walls. But
a young girl of his acquaintance always said she knew it was not
bravery so much as &ldquo;curiosity&rdquo; which led him to &ldquo;go peeping over
the walls, first man!&rdquo; This was a heartless speech, but everybody
repeated it and laughed, for the Colonel <i>was</i> a man of considerable
&ldquo;curiosity!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Like all old homes, Oaklands had its bright as well as its sorrowful
days&mdash;its weddings and its funerals. Many yet remember the
gay wedding of one there whose charms brought suitors by the score,
and won hearts by the dozen. The brilliant career of this young
lady, her conquests and wonderful fascinations, behold, are they not
all written upon the hearts and memories of divers rejected suitors
who still survive?</p>

<p>And apropos of weddings. An old fashioned Virginia wedding
was an event to be remembered. The preparations usually commenced
several weeks before, with saving eggs, butter, chickens, &amp;c.,
after which ensued the liveliest egg-beating; butter-creaming; raisin-stoning;
sugar-pounding; cake-icing; salad-chopping; cocoanut-grating;
lemon squeezing; egg-frothing; wafer-making; pastry-baking;
jelly-straining; paper-cutting; silver-cleaning; floor-rubbing;
dress making; hair-curling; lace-washing; ruffle-crimping;
tarletan-smoothing; guests-arriving; servants-running; trunk-moving;
girls laughing!</p>

<p>Imagine all this going on simultaneously several successive days
and nights, and you have an idea of &ldquo;preparations&rdquo; for an old fashioned
Virginia wedding.</p>

<p>The guests generally arrived in private carriages a day or two be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>fore,
and stayed often a week after the affair, being accompanied by
quite an army of negro servants, who enjoyed the festivities as much
as their masters and mistresses.</p>

<p>A great many years ago, after such a wedding as I describe, a dark
shadow fell upon Oaklands.</p>

<p>The eldest daughter&mdash;young and beautiful, soon to marry a gentleman
of high-toned character, charming manners and large estate&mdash;one
night, while the preparations were in progress for her nuptials,
saw in a vision vivid pictures of what would befall her if she married.
The vision showed her: a gay wedding&mdash;herself the bride&mdash;the marriage
jaunt to her husband&rsquo;s home in a distant county; the incidents
of the journey; her arrival at her new home; her sickness and death;
the funeral procession back to Oaklands; the open grave; the bearers
of her bier&mdash;those who a few weeks before had danced at her wedding;&mdash;herself
a corpse in her bridal dress; her newly turfed grave
with a bird singing in the tree above.</p>

<p>This vision produced such an impression she awakened her sister,
and told it.</p>

<p>Three successive nights the vision appeared, which so affected her
spirits she determined not to marry. But after some months, persuaded
by her family to think no more of the dream which continually
haunted her, the marriage took place.</p>

<p>All was a realization of the vision; the wedding; the journey to
her new home; every incident, however small, had been presented
before her in the dream.</p>

<p>As the bridal party approached the house of an old lady near
Abingdon&mdash;who had made preparations for their entertainment,&mdash;servants
were hurrying to and fro in great excitement, and one was
galloping off for a doctor, as the old lady had been suddenly seized
with a violent illness. Even this was another picture in the ill-omened
vision of the bride, who found every day something occurring
to remind her of it, until in six months her own death made the last
sad scene of her dream. And the funeral procession back to Oaklands;
the persons officiating; the grave, all proved a realization of
her vision.</p>

<p>After this her husband&mdash;a man of true Christian character&mdash;sought
in foreign lands to disperse the gloom overshadowing his life. But
whether on the summit of Mount Blanc or the lava-crusted Vesuvius;
among the classic hills of Rome or the palaces of France; in the art
galleries of Italy or the regions of the Holy Land, he carried ever in
his heart, the image of his fair bride and the quiet grave at Oaklands.</p>

<p>This gentleman still survives, and not long ago we heard him relate,
in charming voice and style, the incidents of these travels.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p>Another charming residence, not far from Oaklands, which attracted
visitors from various quarters, was Buena Vista, where we passed
many happy hours of childhood.</p>

<p>This residence&mdash;large and handsome&mdash;was situated on an eminence,
overlooking pastures and sunny slopes, with forests, and
mountain views in the distance.</p>

<p>The interior of the house accorded with the outside, every article
being elegant and substantial.</p>

<p>The owner&mdash;a gentleman of polished manners, kind and generous
disposition, a sincere Christian and zealous churchman&mdash;was honored
and beloved by all who knew him.</p>

<p>His daughters&mdash;a band of lovely young girls&mdash;presided over his
house, dispensing its hospitality with grace and dignity. Their
mother&rsquo;s death occurring when they were very young had given them
household cares, which would have been considerable, but for the
assistance of Uncle Billy, the butler&mdash;an all-important character presiding
with imposing dignity over domestic affairs.</p>

<p>His jet black face was relieved by a head of grey hair with a small
round bald centre piece; and the expression of his face was calm and
serene, as he presided over the pantry, the table and the tea-waiters.</p>

<p>His mission on earth seemed to be keeping the brightest silver
urns, sugar-dishes, cream-jugs and spoons; flavoring the best ice
creams; buttering the hottest rolls, muffins and waffles; chopping the
best salads; folding the whitest napkins; handing the best tea and
cakes in the parlor in the evenings, and cooling the best wine for the
decanters at dinner. Indeed he was so essentially a part of the
establishment, that in recalling those old days at Buena Vista, the
form of &ldquo;Uncle Billy&rdquo; comes silently back from the past and takes its
old place about the parlors, the halls and the dining-room, making
the picture complete.</p>

<p>And thus upon the canvas of every old home picture come to their
accustomed places, the forms of dusky friends, who once shared our
homes, our firesides, our affections&mdash;and who will share them, as in
the past, never more.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of all the Plantation Homes we loved and visited, the brightest,
sweetest memories cluster around Grove Hill; a grand old place in
the midst of scenery lovely and picturesque, to reach which, we made
a journey across the Blue Ridge&mdash;those giant mountains from whose
winding road and lofty heights we had glimpses of exquisite scenery
in the valleys below.</p>

<p>Thus winding slowly around these mountain heights and peeping
down from our old carriage windows we beheld nature in its wildest
luxuriance. The deep solitude; the glowing sunlight over rock, forest
and glen; the green valleys deep down beneath, diversified by
alternate light and shadow&mdash;all together photographed on our hearts
pictures never to fade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>Not all the towers, minarets, obelisks, palaces, gem-studded domes
of &ldquo;art and man&rsquo;s device&rdquo; can reach the soul like one of these sun-tinted
pictures in their convex frames of rock and vines!</p>

<p>Arrived at Grove Hill, how enthusiastic the welcome from each
member of the family assembled in the front porch to meet us! How
joyous the laugh! How deliciously cool the wide halls, the spacious
parlor, the dark polished walnut floors! How bright the flowers!
How gay the spirits of all assembled there!</p>

<p>One was sure of meeting here agreeable society from Virginia,
Baltimore, Florida, South Carolina and Kentucky, with whom the
house was filled from May &rsquo;till November.</p>

<p>How delightfully passed the days, the weeks! What merry excursions;
fishing parties; riding parties, to the Indian Spring, the
Cave, the Natural Bridge! What pleasant music, and tableaux, and
dancing in the evenings!</p>

<p>For the tableaux, we had only to open an old chest in the garret
and help ourselves to rich embroidered, white and scarlet dresses,
with other costumery worn by the grandmother of the family nearly
a hundred years before, when her husband was in public life and she
one of the queens of society.</p>

<p>What sprightly &ldquo;conversazioni&rdquo; in our rooms at night&mdash;young girls
<i>will</i> become confidential and eloquent with each other at night, however
reserved and quiet during the day!</p>

<p>Late in the night these &ldquo;conversazioni&rdquo; continued, with puns and
laughter, until checked by a certain young gentleman&mdash;now a minister&mdash;who
was wont to bring out his flute in the flower garden under
our windows, and give himself up for an hour or more to the most
sentimental and touching strains, thus breaking in upon sprightly remarks
and repartees, some of which are remembered to this day,
especially one which ran thus:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Girls!&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;Would it not be charming if we could all
take a trip together to Niagara?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, why could we not?&rdquo; was the response.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; replied another, &ldquo;the idea of us poor Virginia girls taking a
trip!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said one of the Grove Hill girls, &ldquo;it would be impossible.
For here are we on this immense estate, 4,000 acres, two large, handsome
residences&mdash;and three hundred negroes&mdash;<i>considered</i> wealthy,
and yet to save our lives could not raise money enough for a trip to
New York!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor get a silk velvet cloak!&rdquo; said her sister, laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;Girls! I have been longing and longing
for a silk velvet cloak, but never could get the money to buy one.
But last Sunday, at the village church, what should I see but one of
the Joneses sweeping in with a long velvet cloak almost touching
the floor! And you could set her father&rsquo;s house in our back hall!
But then she is so fortunate as to own no negroes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a happy girl she must be!&rdquo; cried a chorus of voices. &ldquo;No
negroes to support! <i>We</i> could go to New York and Niagara, and
have velvet cloaks too, if we only had no negroes to support! But
all <i>our</i> money goes to provide for them as soon as the crops are sold!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said one of the Grove Hill girls; &ldquo;here is our large house
without an article of modern furniture. The parlor curtains are one
hundred years old. The old fashioned mirrors and recess tables one
hundred years old, and we long in vain for money to buy something
new.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said one of the sprightliest girls, &ldquo;we can get up some of
our old diamond rings or breastpins which some of us have inherited,
and travel on appearances! We have no modern clothes, but the
old rings will make us &lsquo;<i>look</i> rich!&rsquo; And a party of <i>poor, rich Virginians</i>
will attract the commiseration and consideration of the world when
it is known that for generations we have not been able to leave our
plantations!&rdquo;</p>

<p>After these conversations we would fall asleep and sleep profoundly,
until aroused next morning by an army of servants polishing the
hall floors, waxing and rubbing them with a long-handle brush,
weighted by an oven lid. This made the floor like a &ldquo;sea of glass,&rdquo;
and dangerous to walk upon immediately after the polishing process,
being especially disastrous to small children, who were continually
slipping and falling before breakfast.</p>

<p>The lady presiding over this establishment possessed a cultivated
mind, bright conversational powers and gentle temper, with a force
of character which enabled her to direct judiciously the affairs of her
household, as well as the training and education of her children.</p>

<p>She employed always an accomplished gentleman teacher, who
added to the agreeability of her home circle.</p>

<p>She helped the boys with their Latin and the girls with their compositions.
In her quiet way she governed, controlled, suggested
everything; so that her presence was required everywhere at once.</p>

<p>While in the parlor entertaining her guests with bright, agreeable
conversation, she was sure to be wanted by the cooks&mdash;there were
six!&mdash;to &ldquo;taste or flavor&rdquo; something in the kitchen; or by the gardener
to direct the planting of certain seeds or roots, and so with every
department. Even the minister&mdash;there was always one living in her
house&mdash;would call her out to consult over his text and sermon for
the next Sunday, saying he could rely upon her judgment and discrimination.</p>

<p>Never thinking of herself, her heart overflowing with sympathy
and interest for others, she entered into the pleasures of the young
as well as the sorrows of the old.</p>

<p>If the boys came in from a fox or deer chase, their pleasure was
incomplete until it had been described to her and enjoyed with her
again.</p>

<p>The flower vases were never entirely beautiful until her hand had
helped to arrange the flowers.</p>

<p>The girls&rsquo; laces were never perfect until she had gathered and
crimped them.</p>

<p>Her sons were never so happy as when holding her hand and
caressing her. And the summer twilight found her always in the
vine-covered porch seated by her husband&mdash;a dear, kind old gentleman&mdash;her
hand resting in his, while he quietly and happily smoked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
his pipe, after the day&rsquo;s riding over his plantation, interviewing overseers,
millers, blacksmiths and settling up accounts.</p>

<p>One more reminiscence and the Grove Hill picture will be done.
No Virginia home being complete without some prominent negro
character, the picture lacking this would be untrue to nature, and
without the &ldquo;finishing touch.&rdquo; And not to have &ldquo;stepped in&rdquo; to pay
our respects to old &ldquo;Aunt Betsy&rdquo; during a visit to Grove Hill, would
have been considered&mdash;as it should be to omit it here&mdash;a great breach
of civility; for the old woman always received us at her door with a
cordial welcome and a hearty shake of the hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo; bless de childen!&rdquo; she would say. &ldquo;How they does grow!
Done grown up young ladies! Set down, honey. I mighty glad to
see you. And why didn&rsquo;t your ma (Miss Fanny) come? I would
love to see Miss Fanny. She always was so good and so pretty.
Seems to me it ain&rsquo;t been no time sence she and Miss Emma&rdquo;&mdash;her
own mistress&mdash;&ldquo;used to play dolls together, an&rsquo; I used to bake sweet
cakes for &rsquo;em, and cut &rsquo;em out wid de pepper-box top, for thar doll
parties; an&rsquo; they loved each other like sisters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Aunt Betsy,&rdquo; we would ask, &ldquo;how is your rheumatism now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo;, honey, I nuver specs to git over that. But some days I can
hobble out and feed de chickens; and I can set at my window and
make de black childen feed &rsquo;em, an&rsquo; I love to think I&rsquo;m some account
to Miss Emma. And Miss Emma&rsquo;s childen can&rsquo;t do without old
&lsquo;Mammy Betsy,&rsquo; for I takes care of all thar pet chickens. Me and
my old man (Phil) gittin mighty ole now; but Miss Emma and all
her childen so good to us we has pleasure in livin&rsquo; yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last the shadows began to fall dark and chill upon this once
bright and happy home.</p>

<p>Old Aunt Betsy lived to see the four boys&mdash;her mistress&rsquo; brave and
noble sons&mdash;buckle their armor on and go forth to battle for the home
they loved so well; the youngest, still so young that he loved his pet
chickens, which were left to &ldquo;Mammy Betsy&rsquo;s&rdquo; special care; and
when the sad news, at length, came that this favorite young master
was killed, amid all the agony of grief, no heart felt more sincerely,
than her&rsquo;s, the great sorrow.</p>

<p>Another, and still another of these noble youths fell, after deeds of
valor unparalleled in the world&rsquo;s history&mdash;their graves the battlefield,
a place of burial fit for men so brave. Only one&mdash;the youngest&mdash;was
brought home to find a resting place beside the graves of his
ancestors.</p>

<p>The old man&mdash;their father, his mind shattered by grief&mdash;continued
day after day, for several years, to sit in the vine-covered porch,
gazing wistfully out, imagining sometimes he saw in the distance
the manly forms of his noble sons, returning home, mounted on their
favorite horses, in the gray uniforms and bright armor worn the day
they went off.</p>

<p>Then, he too followed, where the &ldquo;din of war, the clash of arms&rdquo;
is heard no more.</p>

<p>To recall these scenes so blinds my eyes with tears that I can not
write of them. Some griefs leave the heart dumb. They have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
language; and are given no language, because no other heart could
understand, nor could they if shared, be alleviated.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p>It will have been observed from these reminiscences that the mistress
of a Virginia plantation was more conspicuous&mdash;although not
more important&mdash;than the master. In the house she was the mainspring,
and to her came all the hundred, or three hundred negroes
with their various wants, and constant applications for medicine and
every conceivable requirement.</p>

<p>Attending to these, with directing her household affairs and entertaining
company, occupied busily every moment of her life. While
all these devolved upon her, it sometimes seemed to me that the
master had nothing to do, but ride around his estate&mdash;on the most
delightful horse&mdash;receive reports from overseers, see that his pack of
hounds were fed and order &ldquo;repairs about the mill&rdquo;&mdash;the mill seemed
always needing repairs!</p>

<p>This view of the subject, however, being entirely from a feminine
standpoint, may have been wholly erroneous; for doubtless his mind
was burdened with financial matters too weighty to be grasped and
comprehended by our sex.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the mistress held complete sway in her own domain;
and that this fact was recognized will be shown by the following incident:</p>

<p>A gentleman&mdash;an intelligent and successful lawyer&mdash;one day discovering
a negro boy in some mischief about his house, and determining
forthwith to chastise him, took him in the yard for that purpose.
Breaking a small switch, and in the act of &ldquo;coming down
with it&rdquo; upon the boy, he asked: &ldquo;Do you know, sir, who is master
on my place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo; quickly replied the boy. &ldquo;Miss Charlotte, sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Throwing aside the switch, the gentleman ran in the house, laughed
a half hour, and thus ended his only experiment at interfering in
his wife&rsquo;s domain.</p>

<p>His wife, &ldquo;Miss Charlotte,&rdquo; as the negroes called her, was gentle
and indulgent to a fault, which made the incident more amusing.</p>

<p>It may appear singular, yet it is true, that our women, although
having sufficient self-possession at home, and accustomed there
to command on a large scale, became painfully timid if ever they
found themselves in a promiscuous or public assemblage&mdash;shrinking
from everything like publicity.</p>

<p>Still, these women, to whom a whole plantation looked up for
guidance and instruction, could not fail to feel a certain consciousness
of superiority, which, although never displayed or asserted in
manner, became a part of themselves. They were distinguishable
everywhere&mdash;for what reason, exactly, I have never been able to find
out&mdash;for their manners were too quiet to attract attention. Yet a
Captain on a Mississippi steamboat said to me: &ldquo;I always know a
Virginia lady as soon as she steps on my boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; I asked, supposing he would say: &ldquo;By their
plain style of dress and antiquated breastpins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Said he: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been running a boat from Cincinnati to New Orleans
for twenty-five years, and often have three hundred passengers from
various parts of the world. But if there is a Virginia lady among
them, I find it out in half an hour. They take things quietly, and
don&rsquo;t complain. Do you see that English lady over there? Well,
she has been complaining all the way up the Mississippi river. Nobody
can please her. The cabin-maid and steward are worn out
with trying to please her. She says it is because the mosquitoes bit
her so badly coming through Louisiana. But we are almost at Cincinnati
now; haven&rsquo;t seen a mosquito for a week, and she is still
complaining!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;the Virginia ladies look as if they could
not push about for themselves, and for this reason I always feel like
giving them more attention than the other passengers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are inexperienced travelers,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>And these remarks of the Captain convinced me&mdash;I had thought it
before&mdash;that Virginia women should never undertake to travel, but
content themselves with staying at home. However, such restriction
would have been unfair, unless they had felt like the Parisian
who, when asked why the Parisians never traveled, replied: &ldquo;Because
all the world comes to Paris!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed, a Virginian had an opportunity of seeing much choice society
at home; for our watering places attracted the best people from
other States, who often visited us at our houses.</p>

<p>On the Mississippi boat to which I have alluded, it was remarked
that the negro servants paid the Southerners more constant and
deferential attention than the passengers from the non-slaveholding
States&mdash;although some of the latter were very agreeable and intelligent,
and conversed with the negroes on terms of easy familiarity&mdash;showing,
what I had often observed, that the negro respects and admires
those who make a &ldquo;social distinction&rdquo; more than those who
make none.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p>We were surprised to find in an &ldquo;Ode to the South,&rdquo; by Mr. M. F.
Tupper, published recently, the following stanza:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Yes it is slander to say you oppress&rsquo;d them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does a man squander the prize of his pelf.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was it not often that he who possessed them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rather was owned by his servants himself?&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This was true, but that it was known in the outside world we
thought impossible, when all the newspaper and book accounts represented
us as &ldquo;miserable sinners&rdquo; for whom there was no hope here
or hereafter, and called upon all nations, Christian and civilized, to
&ldquo;revile, persecute and exterminate us.&rdquo; Such representations, however,
differed so widely from the facts around us, that when we heard
them they failed to produce a very serious impression, occasioning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
often only a smile, with the exclamation: &ldquo;How little those people
know about us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We had not the vanity to think that the European nations cared
or thought about us, and if the Americans believed these accounts,
they defamed the memory of one held up by them as a model of
Christian virtue,&mdash;George Washington&mdash;a Virginia slave-owner,
whose kindness to his &ldquo;people,&rdquo; as he called his slaves, entitled him
to as much honor as did his deeds of prowess.</p>

<p>But to return to the two last lines of the stanza:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Was it not often that he who possessed them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rather was owned by his servants himself?&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>I am reminded of some who were actually held in such bondage;
especially an old gentleman who, together with his whole plantation,
was literally &ldquo;possessed by his slaves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This gentleman was a widower, and no lady presided over his
house.</p>

<p>His figure was of medium height, and very corpulent. His features
were regular and handsome. His eyes were soft brown, almost
black. His hair was slightly gray. The expression of his countenance
was so full of goodness and sympathy, that a stranger meeting
him in the road might have been convinced at a glance of his kindness
and generosity.</p>

<p>He was never very particular about his dress, yet never appeared
shabby.</p>

<p>Although a graduate in law at the University, an ample fortune
made it unnecessary for him to practice this profession. Still his
taste for literature made him a constant reader, and his conversation
was instructive and agreeable.</p>

<p>His house was old and rambling, and&mdash;I was going to say his
servants kept the keys, when I remembered there were <i>no keys</i> about
the establishment. Even the front door had no lock upon it. Everybody
retired at night in perfect confidence, however, that everything
was secure enough, and it seemed not important to lock the doors.</p>

<p>The negro servants who managed the house were very efficient;
excelling especially in the culinary department, and serving up
dinners which were simply &ldquo;marvels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The superabundance on the place enabled them not only to furnish
their master&rsquo;s table with the choicest meats, vegetables, cakes, pastries,
&amp;c., but also to supply themselves bountifully, and to spread in their
own cabins sumptuous feasts, wedding and party suppers rich enough
for a queen.</p>

<p>To this their master did not object, for he told them &ldquo;if they would
supply his table always with an abundance of the best bread, meats,
cream and butter, he cared not what became of the rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon this principle the plantation was conducted. The well-filled
barns; the stores of bacon, lard, flour, &amp;c., literally belonged to the
negroes, they allowing their master a certain share!</p>

<p>Doubtless they entertained the sentiment of a negro boy, who on
being reproved by his master for having stolen and eaten a turkey,
replied: &ldquo;Well, massa, you see you got less turkey, but you got dat
much more nigger!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>While we were once visiting at this plantation, the master of the
house described to us a dairy just completed on a new plan, which
for some weeks had been such a hobby with him, he had actually purchased
a lock for it, saying he would keep the key himself&mdash;which
he never did&mdash;and have the fresh mutton always put there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said he, as he finished describing it, &ldquo;let us go down and
look at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring me the key,&rdquo; he said to a small African, who soon brought
it, and we proceeded to the dairy.</p>

<p>Turning the key in the door, the old gentleman said: &ldquo;Now see
what an elegant piece of mutton I have here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But on entering and looking around no mutton was to be seen, and
instead thereof buckets of custard, cream and blanc-mange. The
old gentleman greatly disconcerted, called to one of the servants,
&ldquo;Florinda! Where is my mutton I had put here this morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Florinda replied: &ldquo;Nancy took it out, sir, and put it in de ole spring
house. She say dat was cool enough place for mutton. And she
gwine have a big party to-night, and want her jelly and custards to
keep cool!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this the old gentleman was rapidly becoming provoked, when
we laughed so much at Nancy&rsquo;s &ldquo;cool&rdquo; proceeding, that his usual
good nature was restored.</p>

<p>On another occasion we were one evening sitting with this gentleman
in his front porch, when a poor woman from the neighboring village
came in the yard, and stopping before the door, said to him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. R. I came to tell you that my cow you gave me has died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you say, my good woman?&rdquo; asked Mr. R., who was
quite deaf.</p>

<p>The woman repeated in a louder voice, &ldquo;The cow you gave me has
died. And she died because I didn&rsquo;t have anything to feed her with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turning to us, his countenance full of compassion, he said: &ldquo;I
ought to have thought about that, and should have sent the food for
her cow.&rdquo; Then speaking to the woman: &ldquo;Well, my good woman,
I will give you another cow to-morrow, and send you plenty of provision
for her.&rdquo; And the following day he fulfilled his promise.</p>

<p>Another incident occurs to me, showing the generous heart of this
truly good man. One day on the Virginia and Tennessee train observing
a gentleman and lady in much trouble, he ventured to enquire
of them the cause, and was informed they&mdash;the gentleman and his
wife&mdash;had lost all their money and their railroad tickets at the last
station.</p>

<p>He asked the gentleman where he was from, and on &ldquo;what side
he was during the war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am from Georgia,&rdquo; replied the gentleman, &ldquo;and was, of course,
with the South.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. R., pulling from his capacious pocket a capacious
purse, which he handed the gentleman, &ldquo;help yourself, sir, and take
as much as will be necessary to carry you home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The astonished stranger thanked him sincerely, and handed his
card, saying: &ldquo;I will return the money as soon as I reach home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Returned to his own home, and relating the incidents of his trip,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Mr. R. mentioned this, when one of his nephews laughed and said:
&ldquo;Well, Uncle R., we Virginia people are so easily imposed upon!
You don&rsquo;t think that man will ever return your money <i>do</i> you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; replied his Uncle, looking at him reproachfully and
sinking his voice, &ldquo;I was fully repaid by the change which came over
the man&rsquo;s countenance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is due to the Georgian to add that on reaching home, he returned
the money with a letter of thanks.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In sight of the hospitable home of Mr. R. was another equally attractive
owned by his brother-in-law, Mr. B. These had the same
name&mdash;Greenfield&mdash;the property having descended to two sisters, the
wives of these gentlemen. They might have been called twin establishments,
as one was almost a fac simile of the other. At both was
found the same hospitality; the same polished floors; the same style
of loaf-bread and velvet rolls. The only difference between the two
being that Mr. B. kept his doors locked at night; observed more system,
and kept his buggies and carriages in better repair.</p>

<p>These gentlemen were also perfectly congenial. Both had graduated
in law; read the same books; were members of the same
church; knew the same people; liked and disliked the same people;
held the same political opinions; enjoyed the same old Scotch songs;
repeated the same old English poetry; smoked the same kind of tobacco,
in the same kind of pipes; abhorred alike intoxicating drinks,
and deplored the increase of bar-rooms and drunkenness in our land.</p>

<p>For forty years they passed together a part of every day or evening,
smoking and talking over the same events and people. It was
a picture to see them at night over a blazing wood fire, their faces
bright with good nature; and a treat to hear all their reminiscences
of people and events long passed. With what circumstantiality
could they recall old law cases; describe old duels, old political animosities
and excitements! What merry laughs they sometimes had!</p>

<p>Everything on one of these plantations seemed to belong equally
to the other. If the ice gave out at one place, the servants went to
the other for it as a &ldquo;matter of course;&rdquo; or if the buggies or carriages
were out of order at Mr. R.&rsquo;s&mdash;which was often the case&mdash;the driver
would go over for Mr. B.&rsquo;s without even mentioning the circumstance,
and so with everything. The families lived thus harmoniously with
never the least interruption for forty years.</p>

<p>Now and then the old gentlemen enjoyed a practical joke on each
other, and on one occasion Mr R. succeeded so effectually in quizzing
Mr B. that whenever he thought of it afterwards he fell into a dangerous
fit of laughter.</p>

<p>It happened that a man who had married a distant connection of
the Greenfield family concluded to take his wife, children and servants
to pass the summer there, dividing the time between the two
houses. The manners, character and political proclivities of this visitor
became so disagreeable to the old gentleman, they determined he
should not repeat his visit, although they liked his wife. One day
Mr. B. received a letter signed by this objectionable individual&mdash;it
had really been written by Mr. R.&mdash;informing Mr. B. that, &ldquo;as one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
the children was sick, and the physician advised country air he
would be there the following Thursday with his whole family to stay
some months.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The impudent fellow!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. B. as soon as he read the
letter. &ldquo;He knows how R. and myself detest him! Still I am sorry
for his wife. But I will not be dragooned and outgeneraled by that
contemptible fellow. No! I will leave home to-day!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Going to the back door he called in a loud voice for his coachman,
and ordered his carriage. &ldquo;I am going&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to Grove Hill for
a week and from there to Lexington with my whole family, and don&rsquo;t
know when I shall be at home again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very inconvenient,&rdquo; said he to his wife, &ldquo;but I must leave
home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hurrying up the carriage, and the family they were soon off on
their unexpected trip.</p>

<p>They stayed at Grove Hill, seven miles off, a week, during which
time Mr. B. every morning mounted his horse and rode timidly
around the outskirts of his own plantation, peeping over the hills at
his house, but afraid to venture nearer, feeling assured it was occupied
by the objectionable party. He would not even make enquiries
of his negroes whom he met, as to the state and condition of things
in his house.</p>

<p>Concluding to pursue his journey to Lexington and half way there,
he met a young nephew of Mr. R.&rsquo;s, who happened to know all about
the quiz, and immediately suspecting the reason of Mr. B.&rsquo;s exile from
home enquired where he was going, how long he had been from home,
&amp;c. Soon guessing the truth and thinking the &ldquo;joke had been carried
far enough,&rdquo; he told the old gentleman he need not travel any
further for it was all a quiz of his uncle&rsquo;s, and there was no one at
his house. Thereupon, Mr. B. greatly relieved, turned back and
went his way home rejoicing, but &ldquo;determined to pay R.&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;for such a practical joke, which had exiled him from home and given
him such trouble.&rdquo; This caused many a good laugh whenever it was
told, throughout the neighborhood.</p>

<p>The two estates of which I am writing, were well named&mdash;Greenfield,
for the fields and meadows were of the freshest green, and with
majestic hills around and the fine cattle and horses grazing upon
them, formed a noble landscape.</p>

<p>This land had descended in the same family since the Indian camp
fires ceased to burn there, and the same forests were still untouched,
where once stood the Indian&rsquo;s wigwams.</p>

<p>In this connection, I am reminded of a tradition in the Greenfield
family, which showed the heroism of a Virginia boy:</p>

<p>The first white proprietor of this place, the great grandfather of the
present owners, had also a large estate in Montgomery county, called
Smithfield, where his family lived, and where was a fort for the
protection of the whites, when attacked by the Indians.</p>

<p>Once, while the owner was at his Greenfield place, the Indians
surrounded Smithfield, when the white women and children took
refuge in the fort, and the men prepared for battle. They wanted
the proprietor of Smithfield to help fight and take command, for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
was a brave man, but could not spare a man to carry him the news.
So they concluded to send one of his young sons, a lad thirteen years
old, who did not hesitate but mounting a fleet horse set off after dark
and rode all night through dense forests filled with hostile Indians,
reaching Greenfield, a distance of forty miles next morning. He
soon returned with his father, and the Indians were repulsed. And
I always thought that boy was courageous enough for his name to
live in history.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The Indians afterwards told that the whole day before the fight
several of their chiefs had been concealed near the Smithfield house,
under a large hay stack, upon which the white children had been
sliding and playing all day, little suspecting the gleaming tomahawks
and savage men beneath.</p>

<p>From the Greenfield estate in Botetourt and the one adjacent went
the ancestors of the Prestons and Breckinridges, who made these
names distinguished in South Carolina and Kentucky. And on this
place are the graves of the first Breckinridges who emigrated to this
country.</p>

<p>All who visited at the homesteads just described retained ever after
a recollection of the superbly cooked meats, bread, &amp;c., seen upon
the tables at both houses&mdash;there being at each place five or six negro
cooks, who had been taught by their mistresses the highest style of
the art.</p>

<p>During the summer season several of these cooks were hired at the
different watering places, where they acquired great fame and made
for themselves a considerable sum of money by selling recipes.</p>

<p>A lady of the Greenfield family, who married and went to Georgia,
told me she had often tried to make velvet rolls like those she had
been accustomed to see at her own home, but never succeeded. Her
mother and aunt who had taught these cooks, having died many
years before, she had to apply to the negroes for information on such
subjects, and they, she said, would never show her the right way to
make them. Finally, while visiting at a house in Georgia, this lady
was surprised to see the very velvet rolls, like those at her home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you get the recipe?&rdquo; she soon asked the lady of the
house, who replied, &ldquo;I bought it from old Aunt Rose, a colored cook,
at the Virginia Springs, and paid her five dollars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of our own cooks and my mother&rsquo;s recipe,&rdquo; exclaimed the
other, &ldquo;and I had to come all the way to Georgia to get it, for Aunt
Rose never would show me exactly how to make them!&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p>Not far from Greenfield was a place called &ldquo;Rustic Lodge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This house surrounded by a forest of grand old oaks, was not large
or handsome. But its inmates were ladies and gentlemen of the old
English style.</p>

<p>The grandmother, about ninety years of age, had been in her youth
one of the belles at the Williamsburg Court in old colonial days. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
daughter of Sir Dudley Digges, and descended from English nobility,
she had been accustomed to the best society. Her manners and conversation
were dignified and attractive.</p>

<p>Among reminiscences of colonial times, she remembered Lord
Botetourt, of whom she related interesting incidents.</p>

<p>The son of this old lady, about sixty years of age, and the proprietor
of the estate, was a true picture of the &ldquo;old English gentleman.&rdquo;
His manners, conversation, thread-cambric shirt frills, cuffs and
long queue tied with a black ribbon, made the picture complete.
His two daughters, young ladies of exquisite refinement, had been
brought up by their aunt and grandmother to observe strictly all the
proprieties of life.</p>

<p>This establishment was proverbial for its order and method, the
most systematic rules being in force everywhere. The meals were
served punctually at the same instant every day. Old &ldquo;Aunt Nelly&rdquo;
dressed and undressed her old mistress always at the same hour. A
gentle &ldquo;tapping at the chamber door&rdquo;&mdash;not by the &ldquo;raven,&rdquo; but the
cook&mdash;called the mistress to an interview at the same moment every
morning with that functionary, which resulted in the choicest
dinners, breakfasts and suppers; this interview lasting half an hour
and never repeated during the day.</p>

<p>Exactly at the same hour every morning the old gentleman&rsquo;s horse
was saddled, and he entered the neighboring village so promptly as
to enable some of the inhabitants to set their clocks by him.</p>

<p>This family had possessed great wealth in Eastern Virginia during
the colonial government under which many of its members held high
offices.</p>

<p>But impoverished by high living, entertaining company and a
heavy British debt, they had been reduced in their possessions to
about fifty negroes, with only money enough to purchase this plantation
upon which they had retired from the gay and charming society
of Williamsburg. They carried with them, however, some remains
of their former grandeur: old silver, old jewelry, old books, old and
well-trained servants, and an old English coach, which was the curiosity
of all other vehicular curiosities. How the family ever climbed
into it, or got out of it, and how the driver ever reached the dizzy
height upon which he sat, was the mystery of my childhood.</p>

<p>But although egg-shaped and suspended in mid-air, this coach had
doubtless, in its day, been one of considerable renown, drawn by
four horses, with footman, postillion and driver in English livery.</p>

<p>How sad must have been its reflections on finding itself shorn of
these respectable surroundings, and after the revolution drawn by
two Republican horses, with footman and driver dressed in Republican
jeans!</p>

<p>Strange that it could have lived on and on thus Republicanized!</p>

<p>A great uncle of this family, unlike the coach never would become
Republicanized, and his obstinate loyalty to the English crown, with
his devotion to everything English gained for him the title &ldquo;English
Louis,&rdquo; by which name he is spoken of in the family to this day. An
old lady told me not long ago that she remembered when a child the
arrival of &ldquo;English Louis&rdquo; at &ldquo;Rustic&rdquo; one night, and his conversa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>tion
as they sat around the fire, how he deplored a Republican form
of government, and the misfortunes which would result from it saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;All may go smoothly for about seventy years, when civil war will
set in. First, it will be about these negro slaves we have around us,
and after that it will be something else.&rdquo; And how true &ldquo;English
Louis&rsquo;&rdquo; prediction has proven.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Doubtless this gentleman was avoided and proscribed on account
of his English proclivities. For at that day the spirit of Republicanism
and hatred to England ran high; so that an old gentleman&mdash;one
of our relatives whom I well remember&mdash;actually took from his parlor
walls his coat of arms which had been brought by his grandfather
from England, and carrying it out in his yard built a fire and collecting
his children around it, to see it burn, said: &ldquo;Thus let everything
English perish!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Should I say what I think of this proceeding, I would not be considered
perhaps a true Republican patriot.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I cannot forget to mention in the catalogue of pleasant homes,
Smithfield in Montgomery county, the county which flows with healing
waters.</p>

<p>Smithfield, like Greenfield, is owned by the descendants of the first
white family who settled there after the Indians, and its verdant pastures,
noble forests, mountain streams and springs, with the superb
cattle on its hills form a prospect, wondrously beautiful.</p>

<p>This splendid estate descended to three brothers, who equally divided
it; the eldest keeping the homestead, and the others building
attractive homes on their separate plantations.</p>

<p>The old homestead was quite antique in appearance. Inside the
high mantlepieces reaching nearly to the ceiling, which was also
high, and the high wainscotting together with the old furniture made
a picture of the olden time.</p>

<p>When I first visited this place, the old grandmother, then eighty
years of age, was living. She, like the old lady at &ldquo;Rustic,&rdquo; had
been a belle in Eastern Virginia in her youth. When she married
the owner of Smithfield sixty years before, she made the &ldquo;bridal
jaunt&rdquo; from Norfolk to this place on horseback, two hundred miles.
Still exceedingly intelligent and interesting, she entertained us with
various incidents of her early life, and wished to hear all the old
songs which she had then heard and sung herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I was married&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and came first to Smithfield my
husband&rsquo;s sisters met me in the porch, and were shocked at my pale and
delicate appearance. One of them whispering to her brother, asked,
&lsquo;Why did you bring that ghost up here?&rsquo; And now,&rdquo; continued
the old lady, &ldquo;I have outlived all who were in the house that day,
and all my own and my husband&rsquo;s family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was an evidence certainly of the health restoring properties of
the water and climate in this region.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>The houses of these three brothers were filled with company winter
and summer, making within themselves a delightful society. The
visitors at one house were equally visitors at the others, and the
succession of dinner and evening parties from one to the other, made
it difficult for a visitor to decide at whose particular house he was
staying.</p>

<p>One of these brothers had married a lovely lady from South Carolina,
whose perfection of character and disposition endeared her to
every one who knew her. Everybody felt like loving her the moment
they saw her, and the more they knew her the more they loved her.
Her warm heart was ever full of other people&rsquo;s troubles or joys, never
thinking of herself. In her house many an invalid was cheered by
her tender care; and many a drooping heart revived by her bright
Christian spirit. She never omitted an opportunity of pointing the
way to heaven; and although surrounded by all the allurements
which gay society and wealth could bring, she did not depart an instant
from the quiet path which leads to heaven. In the midst of
bright and happy surroundings, her thoughts and hopes were constantly
centered upon the life above; and her conversation&mdash;which
was the reflex of her heart&mdash;reverted ever to this theme, which she
made attractive to old and young.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<p>In the region of country just described and in the counties beyond
abound the finest mineral springs, one or more being found on every
plantation. At one place were seven different springs, and the servants
had a habit of asking the guests and family whether they would
have&mdash;before breakfast&mdash;a glass of White Sulphur, Yellow Sulphur,
Black Sulphur, Alleghany, Alum, or Limestone water!</p>

<p>The old Greenbriar White Sulphur was a favorite place of resort
for Eastern Virginians and South Carolinians at a very early date,
when it was accessible only by private conveyances, and all who
passed the summer there went in private carriages. In this way,
certain old Virginia and South Carolina families met every season,
and these old people told us that society there was never as good,
after the railroads and stages brought &ldquo;all sorts of people, from all
sorts of places.&rdquo; This, of course, we knew nothing about from experience,
and it sounded rather egotistical in the old people to say so,
but that is what they said.</p>

<p>Indeed these &ldquo;old folks&rdquo; talked so much about what &ldquo;used to be in
their day&rdquo; at the old White Sulphur, I found it hard to convince myself
I had not been bodily present, seeing with my own eyes certain
knee-buckled old gentlemen, with long queues, and certain Virginia
and South Carolina belles attired in short-waisted, simple white cambrics,
who passed the summers there. These white cambrics, we
were told, had been carried in minute trunks behind the carriages;
and were considered, with a few jewels and a long black or white
lace veil thrown over the head and shoulders, a complete outfit for
the reigning belles! Another curiosity was, that these white cam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>bric
dresses&mdash;our grandmothers told us&mdash;required very little &ldquo;doing
up;&rdquo; one such having been worn by Mrs. General Washington&mdash;so
her granddaughter told me&mdash;a whole week without requiring washing!
It must have been an age of remarkable women, and remarkable
cambrics! How little they dreamed then of an era when Saratoga
trunks would be indispensable to ladies of much smaller means
than Virginia and South Carolina belles!</p>

<p>To reach these counties flowing with mineral waters the families
from Eastern Virginia and from South Carolina passed through a
beautiful region known as Piedmont, Va., and those who had &ldquo;kinsfolk
or acquaintance&rdquo; here usually stopped to make them a visit.
Consequently the Piedmont Virginians were generally too busy entertaining
summer guests to visit the springs themselves. But indeed
why should they? For no more salubrious climate could be found
than their own; and no scenery more grand and beautiful. But it
was necessary for the tide-water Virginians to leave their homes
every summer on account of chills and fevers.</p>

<p>In the lovely Piedmont region over which the &ldquo;Peaks of Otter&rdquo;
rear their giant heads, and chains of blue mountains extend as far
as eye can reach, were scattered many pleasant and picturesque homes.
And in this section my grandfather bought a plantation, when the
ancestral estates had been sold, in the Eastern part of the State, to
repay the British debt, which estates, homesteads and tombstones
with their quaint inscriptions are described in Bishop Meade&rsquo;s &ldquo;Old
Churches and Families of Virginia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While the tide water Virginians were already practicing all the
arts and wiles known to the highest English civilization; were sending
their sons to be educated in England; receiving brocaded silks
and powdered wigs from England; and dancing the minuet at the
Williamsburg balls with the families of the noblemen sent over to
govern the Colony, Piedmont, Virginia, was still a dense forest, the
abode of Indians and wild animals.</p>

<p>It was not strange, then, that the Piedmont Virginians never arrived
at the opulent manner of living adopted by those on James and
York rivers, who, tradition tells us, went to such excess in high living,
as to have &ldquo;hams boiled in champagne,&rdquo; and of whom other traditions
have been handed down amusing and interesting. Although
the latter were in advance of the Piedmont Virginians in wealth and
social advantages, they were not superior to them in honor, virtue,
or kindness and hospitality.</p>

<p>It has been remarked that, &ldquo;when natural scenery is picturesque
there is in the human character something to correspond; impressions
made on the retina are really made on the soul, and the mind becomes
what it contemplates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The same author continues: &ldquo;A man is not only <i>like</i> what he sees,
but he <i>is</i> what he sees. The noble old Highlander has mountains in
his soul, whose towering peaks point heavenward; and lakes in his
bosom, whose glassy surface reflects the skies; and foaming cataracts
in his heart to beautify the mountain side and irrigate the vale;
and evergreen firs and mountain pines that show life and verdure
even under winter skies!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;On the other hand,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;the wandering nomad has a
desert in his heart; its dead level reflects heat and hate; a sullen,
barren plain&mdash;no goodness, no beauty, no dancing wave of joy, no
gushing rivulet of love, no verdant hope. And it is an interesting
fact that those who live in countries where natural scenery inspires
the soul, and where the necessities of life bind to a permanent home,
are always patriotic and high minded; and those who dwell in the
desert are always pusillanimous and groveling!&rdquo;</p>

<p>If what this author writes be true, and the character of the Piedmont
Virginians accords with the scenery around them, how their
hearts must be filled with gentleness and charity inspired by the landscape
which stretches far and fades in softness against the sky!
How must their minds be filled with noble aspirations suggested by
the &ldquo;everlasting mountains!&rdquo; How their souls must be filled with
thoughts of heaven, as they look upon the glorious sunsets bathing the
mountains in &ldquo;rose-colored light;&rdquo; with the towering peaks ever
pointing heavenward and seeming to say: &ldquo;Behold the glory of a
world beyond!&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Beneath the shadow of the &ldquo;Peaks&rdquo; were many happy homes and
true hearts, and among these memory recalls none more vividly than
&ldquo;Otterburn&rdquo; and its inmates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Otterburn&rdquo; was the residence of a gentleman and his wife, who,
having no children, devoted themselves to making their home attractive
to visitors, in which they succeeded so well that they were rarely
without company; for all who went once to see them went again
and again.</p>

<p>This gentleman&rsquo;s mind, character, accomplishments, manner and
appearance marked him &ldquo;rare&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;one in a century.&rdquo; Above his
fellow men in greatness of soul, he could comprehend nothing &ldquo;mean.&rdquo;
His stature was tall and erect; his features bold; his countenance
open and impressive; his mind vigorous and cultivated; his bearing
dignified, but not haughty; his manners simple and attractive; his
conversation so agreeable and enlivening that the dullest company
became animated as soon as he came into the room. Truth and
high-toned character were so unmistakably stamped upon him, that
knowing him a day convinced one he could be trusted forever.
Brought up in Scotland&mdash;the home of his ancestors&mdash;in him were
blended the best points of Scotch and Virginia character; strict integrity
and accuracy, with whole-souled generosity and hospitality.</p>

<p>How many days and nights we passed at his house, and in childhood
and youth, how many hours were entertained by his bright
and instructive conversation! Especially delightful was it to hear
his stories about Scotland, which brought before us vividly pictures
of its lakes and mountains and castles. How often did we listen to
his account of the wedding tour to Scotland, when he carried his
Virginia bride to the old home at Greenock! And how often we
laughed about the Scotch children, his nieces and nephews, who on
first seeing his wife, clapped their hands and shouted, &ldquo;Oh! mother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
are you not glad uncle did not marry a black woman?&rdquo; Hearing he
was to marry a Virginian, they expected to see a savage Indian or
negro! And some of the family who went to Liverpool to meet
them, and were looking through spy glasses when the vessel landed,
said they &ldquo;were sure the Virginia lady had not come, because they
saw no one among the passengers dressed in a red shawl and gaudy
bonnet like an Indian!&rdquo;</p>

<p>From this we thought the Europeans must be very ignorant of our
country and its inhabitants&mdash;and have learned since that their children
are kept purposely ignorant of facts in regard to America and
its people.</p>

<p>Among many other recollections of this dear old friend of &ldquo;Otterburn,&rdquo;
I shall never forget a dream he told us one night, which so impressed
us that before his death we asked him to write it out, which
he did, and as the copy is before me in his own handwriting, will
insert it here:</p>

<p>&ldquo;About the time I became of age, I returned to Virginia for the
purpose of looking after and settling my father&rsquo;s estate. Three years
thereafter I received a letter from my only sister, informing me that
she was going to be married, and pressing me in the most urgent
manner to return to Scotland to be present at her marriage, and to
attend to the drawing of the marriage contract. The letter gave me
a good deal of trouble, as it did not suit me to leave Virginia at that
time. I went to bed one night thinking much on this subject, but
soon fell asleep and dreamed that I landed in Greenoch in the night
time, and pushed for home, thinking I would take my aunt and sister
by surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I arrived at the door, I found all still and quiet, and the out
door locked&mdash;I thought, however, that I had in my pocket my check
key, with which I quietly opened the door and groped my way into
the sitting-room, but finding no one there I concluded they had gone
to bed. I then went up stairs to their bed-room, and found that unoccupied.
I then concluded they had taken possession of my bed-room
in my absence, but not finding them there became very uneasy
about them. Then it struck me they might be in the guest&rsquo;s chamber,
a room down stairs kept exclusively for company. Upon going there
I found the door partially open; I saw my aunt removing the burning
coals from the top of the grate preparatory to going to bed. My
sister was sitting up in bed, and as I entered the room, she fixed her
eyes upon me, but did not seem to recognize me. I approached towards
her, and in the effort to make myself known, awoke, and
found it all a dream. At breakfast next morning, I felt wearied and
sick, and could not eat; and told the family of my (dream) journey
the overnight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I immediately commenced preparing, and in a very short time
returned to Scotland. I saw my sister married, and she and her husband
set off on their &lsquo;marriage jaunt.&rsquo; About a month thereafter
they returned, and at dinner I commenced telling them of my dream,
but observing they had quit eating and were staring at me, I laughed,
and asked what was the matter; whereupon my brother-in-law very
seriously asked me to go on. When I finished they asked me if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
remembered the exact time of my dream. I told them it distressed
and impressed me so strongly, that I noted it down at the time. I
pulled out my pocket-book and shewed them the date, &lsquo;14th day of
May,&rsquo; written in pencil. They all rose from the table and took me
into the bed-room and shewed me written with pencil on the white
mantle piece &lsquo;14th of May.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I asked them what that meant, and was informed that on that
very night&mdash;and <i>the only night</i> they ever occupied that room during
my absence&mdash;my aunt was taking the coals off of the fire, when my
sister screamed out, &lsquo;brother has come!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My aunt scolded her, and said she was dreaming; but she said
she had not been to sleep, was sitting up in bed, and <i>saw me</i> enter
the room, and run out when she screamed. So confident was she
that she had seen me, and that I had gone off and hidden, that the
whole house was thoroughly searched for me, and as soon as day
dawned a messenger was sent to enquire if any vessel had arrived
from America, or if I had been seen by any of my friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one can forget, who visited Otterburn, the smiling faces of the
negro servants about the house, who received the guests with as true
cordiality as did their mistress, expressing their pleasure by widespread
mouths showing white teeth&mdash;very white by contrast with
their jet black skin&mdash;and when the guests went away always insisted
on their remaining longer.</p>

<p>One of these negro women was not only an efficient servant, but
a valued friend to her mistress.</p>

<p>In the absence of her master and mistress she kept the keys, often
entertaining their friends, who in passing from distant plantations
were accustomed to stop, and who received from her a cordial welcome,
finding on the table as many delicacies as if the mistress had
been at home.</p>

<p>No more sincere attachment could have existed than between this
mistress and servant. At last, when the latter was seized with a
contagious fever which ended her life, she could not have had a more
faithful friend and nurse than was her mistress.</p>

<p>The same fever attacked all the negroes on this plantation, and
none can describe the anxiety, care and distress of their owners, who
watched by their beds day and night, administering medicine and relieving
the sick and dying.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p>Among other early recollections is a visit with my mother to the
plantation of a favorite cousin, not far from Richmond, and one of
the handsomest seats on James river. This residence&mdash;Howard&rsquo;s
Neck&mdash;was a favorite resort for people from Richmond and the adjacent
counties; and, like many others on the river, always full of
guests&mdash;a round of visiting and dinner parties being kept up from
one house to another,&mdash;so that the ladies presiding over these establishments
had no time to attend to domestic duties, which were left
to their housekeepers, while they were employed entertaining visitors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>The negroes on the these estates appeared lively and happy; that
is, if singing and laughing indicates happiness; for they went to
their work in the fields singing, and returned in the evening singing,
after which they often spent the whole night visiting from one plantation
to another, or dancing until day to the music of the banjo or
&ldquo;fiddle.&rdquo; These dances were wild and boisterous, their evolutions
being like those of the savage dances, described by travelers in
Africa. Although the most perfect timists, their music with its wild,
melancholy cadence, half savage, half civilized, can not be imitated
or described. Many a midnight were we wakened by their wild
choruses, sung as they returned from a frolic or &ldquo;corn shucking,&rdquo;
sounding at first like some hideous, savage yell, but dying away on
the air, echoing a cadence melancholy and indescribable, with a
peculiar pathos, and yet without melody or sweetness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Corn shuckings&rdquo; were occasions of great hilarity and good eating.
The negroes from various plantations assembled at night around a
huge pile of corn. Selecting one among them, the most original,
amusing and having the loudest voice, they called him &ldquo;Captain.&rdquo;
The &ldquo;Captain&rdquo; seated himself on top of the pile&mdash;a large lightwood
torch burning in front of him&mdash;and while he shucked improvised
words and music to a wild &ldquo;recitative,&rdquo; the chorus of which was
&ldquo;caught up&rdquo; by the army of &ldquo;shuckers&rdquo; around. The glare of the
torches on the black faces, with the wild music and impromptu words,
made a scene curious even to us who were so accustomed to it.</p>

<p>After the corn was shucked they assembled around a table laden
with roast pigs, mutton, beef, hams, cakes, pies, coffee, and other
substantials&mdash;many participating in the supper who had not in the
work. The laughing and merriment continued until one or two
o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On these James river plantations were entertained often distinguished
foreigners, who visiting Richmond desired to see something
of Virginia country life. Mr. Thackeray was once entertained at
one of them. But Dickens never visited them. Could he have passed
a month, at any one of the homes I have described, he would
have written something more flattering, I am sure, of Americans and
American life than is found in &ldquo;Martin Chuzzlewit&rdquo; and &ldquo;Notes on
America.&rdquo; However, with these we should not quarrel, as some of
the sketches&mdash;especially the one on &ldquo;tobacco chewers,&rdquo; we can recognize.</p>

<p>Every nation has a right to its prejudices&mdash;certainly the English
towards the American&mdash;America appearing to the English eye a huge
mushroom affair, the growth of a night and unsubstantial. But it is
surely wrong to censure a whole nation&mdash;as some have done the
Southern people&mdash;for the faults of a few. For although every nation
has a right to its prejudices, none has a right, without thorough examination
and acquaintance with the subject, to seize a few exaggerated
accounts, of another nation by its enemies, and publish them as
facts. The world in this way receives very erroneous impressions.</p>

<p>For instance, we have no right to suppose the Germans a cruel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
race because of the following paragraph clipped from a recent newspaper:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cruelty of German officers is a matter of notoriety, but an
officer in an artillery regiment has lately gone beyond precedent in
ingenuity of cruelty. Some of his men being insubordinate, he punished
them by means of a &lsquo;spurring process,&rsquo; which consisted in jabbing
spurs persistently and brutally into their legs. By this process
his men were so severely injured they had to go to the hospital.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neither have we a right to pronounce all Pennsylvanians cruel to
their &ldquo;helps,&rdquo; as they call them, because a Pennsylvania lady told
me &ldquo;the only way she could manage her &lsquo;help&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;a white girl fourteen
years old&mdash;&ldquo;was by holding her head under the pump and pumping
water upon it until she lost her breath;&rdquo; a process I could not
have conceived, and which filled me with horror.</p>

<p>But sorrow and oppression, we suppose, may be found in some
form in every clime; and in every phase of existence some hearts are
&ldquo;weary and heavy laden.&rdquo; Even Dickens, whose mind naturally
sought, and fed upon, the comic, saw wrong and oppression in the
&ldquo;humane institutions&rdquo; of his own land!</p>

<p>And Macaulay gives a painful picture of Madam D&rsquo;Arblay&rsquo;s life as
waiting maid to Queen Charlotte&mdash;from which we are not to infer,
however, that all Queens are cruel to their waiting maids.</p>

<p>Madam D&rsquo;Arblay&mdash;whose maiden name was Frances Burney&mdash;was
the first female novelist in England, who deserved and received
the applause of her countrymen. The most eminent men of London
paid homage to her genius. Johnson, Burke, Windham, Gibbon,
Reynolds, Sheridan, were her friends and ardent eulogists. In the
midst of her literary fame, surrounded by congenial friends, herself
a star in this select and brilliant coterie, she was offered the place of
waiting maid in the palace. She accepted the position, and bade
farewell to all congenial friends and pursuits. &ldquo;And now began,&rdquo;
says Macaulay, &ldquo;a slavery of five years&mdash;of five years taken from
the best part of her life, and wasted in menial drudgery. The history
of an ordinary day was this: Miss Burney had to rise and dress
herself early, that she might be ready to answer the royal bell,
which rang at half after seven. Till about eight she attended in the
Queen&rsquo;s dressing-room, and had the honor of lacing her august
mistress&rsquo; stays, and of putting on the hoop, gown and neckhandkerchief.
The morning was chiefly spent in rummaging drawers and
laying fine clothes in their proper places. Then the Queen was to
be powdered and dressed for the day. Twice a week her Majesty&rsquo;s
hair had to be curled and craped; and this operation added a full
hour to the business of the toilet. It was generally three before Miss
Burney was at liberty. At five she had to attend her colleague,
Madame Schwellenberg, a hateful old toadeater, as illiterate as a
chamber-maid, proud, rude, peevish, unable to bear solitude, unable
to conduct herself with common decency in society. With this delightful
associate Frances Burney had to dine and pass the evening.
The pair generally remained together from five to eleven, and often
had no other company the whole time. Between eleven and twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the bell rang again. Miss Burney had to pass a half hour undressing
the Queen, and was then at liberty to retire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now and then, indeed, events occurred which disturbed the
wretched monotony of Frances Burney&rsquo;s life. The court moved from
Kew to Windsor, and from Windsor back to Kew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A more important occurrence was the King&rsquo;s visit to Oxford.
Then Miss Burney had the honor of entering Oxford in the last of a
long string of carriages, which formed the royal procession, of walking
after the Queen all day through refectories and chapels, and of
standing half dead with fatigue and hunger, while her august mistress
was seated at an excellent cold collation. At Magdalen College,
Frances was left for a moment in a parlor, where she sank
down on a chair. A good natured equerry saw that she was exhausted,
and shared with her some apricots and bread, which he had
wisely put in his pockets. At that moment the door opened, the
Queen entered, the wearied attendants sprang up, the bread and
fruit were hastily concealed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After this the King became very ill, and during more than two
years after his recovery Frances dragged on a miserable existence
at the palace. Madame Schwellenberg became more and more insolent
and intolerable, and now the health of poor Frances began to
give way; and all who saw her pale face, her emaciated figure and
her feeble walk, predicted that her sufferings would soon be over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Queen seems to have been utterly regardless of the <i>comfort</i>,
the <i>health</i>, the <i>life</i> of her attendants. Weak, feverish, hardly able to
stand, Frances had still to rise before seven, in order to dress the
sweet Queen, and sit up &rsquo;till midnight, in order to undress the sweet
Queen. The indisposition of the handmaid could not, and <i>did not
escape the notice of</i> her royal mistress. But the <i>established doctrine of
the court was, that all sickness</i> was to be <i>considered as a pretence until it
proved fatal</i>. The only way in which the invalid could clear herself
from the suspicion of malingering, as it is called in the army, was to
go on lacing and unlacing, <i>&rsquo;till she felt down dead at the royal feet</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Finally Miss Burney&rsquo;s father pays her a visit in this palace prison
when &ldquo;she told him that she was miserable, that she was worn with
attendance and want of sleep, that she had no comfort in life, nothing
to love, nothing to hope, that her family and friends were to her
as though they were not, and were remembered by her as men remember
the dead. From daybreak to midnight the same killing
labor, the same recreation, more hateful than labor itself, followed
each other without variety, without any interval of liberty or repose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her father&rsquo;s veneration for royalty amounting to idolatry, he could
not bear to remove her from the court&mdash;&ldquo;and, between the dear father
and the sweet Queen, there seemed to be little doubt that some day
or other Frances <i>would drop down a corpse</i>. Six months had elapsed
since the interview between the parent and the daughter. The
resignation was not sent in. The sufferer grew worse and worse.
She took bark, but it soon failed to produce a beneficial effect. She
was stimulated with wine; she was soothed with opium, but in vain.
Her breath began to fail. The whisper that she was in a decline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
spread through the court. The pains in her side became so severe
that she was forced to crawl from the card table of the old fury,
Madame Schwellenberg, to whom she was tethered, three or four
times in an evening, for the purpose of taking hartshorn. Had she
been a negro slave, a humane planter would have excused her from
work. But her Majesty showed no mercy. Thrice a day the accursed
bell still rang; the Queen was still to be dressed for the morning at
seven, and to be dressed for the day at noon, and to be undressed at
midnight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last Miss Burney&rsquo;s father was moved to compassion and allowed
her to write a letter of resignation. &ldquo;Still I could not,&rdquo; writes Miss
Burney in her diary, &ldquo;summon courage to present my memorial
from seeing the Queen&rsquo;s entire freedom from such an expectation.
For though I was frequently so ill in her presence that I could hardly
stand, I saw she concluded me, while life remained, inevitably hers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At last, with a trembling hand, the paper was delivered. Then
came the storm. Madame Schwellenberg raved like a maniac. The
resignation was not accepted. The father&rsquo;s fears were aroused, and
he declared, in a letter meant to be shown to the Queen, that his
daughter must retire. The Schwellenberg raged like a wild cat. A
scene almost horrible ensued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Queen then promised that, after the next birthday, Miss
Burney should be set at liberty. But the promise was ill kept; and
her Majesty showed displeasure at being reminded of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At length, however, the prison door was opened, and Frances
was free once more. Her health was restored by traveling, and she
returned to London in health and spirits. Macaulay tells us that
she went to visit the palace, &ldquo;her <i>old dungeon, and found her successor
already far on the way to the grave, and kept to strict duty, from morning
till midnight, with a sprained ankle and a nervous fever</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An ignorant and unlettered woman would doubtless not have
found this life in the palace tedious, and our sympathy would not
have been aroused for her; for as long as the earth lasts there must
be human beings fitted for every station, and it is supposed, till the
end of all things, there must be cooks, housemaids and dining-room
servants, which will make it never possible for the whole human
family to stand entirely upon the same platform socially and intellectually.
And Miss Burney&rsquo;s wretchedness, which calls forth our
sympathy, was not because she had to perform the duties of waiting-maid,
but because to a gifted and educated woman these duties were
uncongenial; and congeniality means <i>happiness</i>; uncongeniality
<i>unhappiness</i>.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<p>From the sorrows of Miss Burney in the palace&mdash;a striking contrast
with the menials described in our own country homes&mdash;I will
return to another charming place on James river&mdash;Powhatan Seat&mdash;a
mile below Richmond, which had descended in the Mayo family
two hundred years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>Here, it was said, the Indian chief Powhatan had lived, and here
was shown the veritable stone supposed to have been the one upon
which Captain Smith&rsquo;s head was laid, when the Indian princess
Pocahontas rescued him.</p>

<p>This historic stone, near the parlor window, was only an ugly,
dark, broad, flat stone, but imagination pictured ever around it the
Indian group; Smith&rsquo;s head upon it; the infuriated chief with uplifted
club in the act of dealing the death blow; the grief and shriek of
Pocahontas, as she threw herself upon Smith imploring her father to
spare him&mdash;a piercing cry to have penetrated the heart of the savage
king!</p>

<p>Looking out from the parlor window and imagining this savage
scene, how strange a contrast with the picture which met the eye within!
Around the fireside assembled the loveliest family group, where kindness
and affection beamed in every eye, and father, mother, brothers
and sisters were linked together by tenderest devotion and sympathy.</p>

<p>If natural scenery reflects itself upon the heart no wonder a &ldquo;holy
calm&rdquo; rested upon this family, for far down the river the prospect
was peace and tranquility; and many an evening in the summer
house on the river bank, we drank in the beauty of soft blue skies,
green isles and white sails floating in the distance.</p>

<p>Many in Richmond remember the delightful weddings and parties
at Powhatan Seat, where assembled the elite from Richmond, with
an innumerable throng of cousins, aunts and uncles from Orange
and Culpeper counties.</p>

<p>On these occasions the house was illuminated by wax-lights issuing
from bouquets of magnolia leaves placed around the walls near
the ceiling, and looking prettier than any glass chandelier.</p>

<p>We, from a distance, generally stayed a week after the wedding,
becoming, as it were, a part of the family circle; and the bride did
not rush off on a tour as is the fashion now-a-days, but remained
quietly enjoying family, home and friends.</p>

<p>Another feature I have omitted in describing our weddings and
parties&mdash;invariably a part of the picture&mdash;was the sea of black faces
surrounding the doors and windows to look on the dancing, hear the
music and afterwards get a good share of the supper.</p>

<p>Tourists often went to walk around the beautiful grounds at
Powhatan&mdash;so neatly kept with sea shells around the flowers, and
pleasant seats under the lindens and magnolias&mdash;and to see the historic
stone; but I often thought they knew not what was missed in
not knowing&mdash;as we did&mdash;the lovely family within.</p>

<p>But, for us, those rare, beautiful days at Powhatan are gone forever;
for since the war the property has passed into stranger hands,
and the family who once owned it will own it no more.</p>

<p>During the late war heavy guns were placed in the family burying
ground on this plantation,&mdash;a point commanding the river&mdash;and
here was interred the child of a distinguished General<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> in the Northern
army&mdash;a Virginian, formerly in the United States army&mdash;who
had married a member of the Powhatan family. He was expected
to make an attack upon Richmond, and over his child&rsquo;s grave was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
placed a gun to fire upon him. Such are the unnatural incidents of
civil war.</p>

<p>About two miles from Powhatan Seat was another beautiful old
place&mdash;Mount Erin&mdash;the plantation formerly of a family all of whom,
except two sisters had died. The estate becoming involved had to
be sold, which so grieved and distressed these sisters that they passed
hours weeping, if accidentally the name of their old home was
mentioned in their presence.</p>

<p>Once when we were at Powhatan&mdash;and these ladies were among
the guests&mdash;a member of the Powhatan family ordered the carriage,
and took my sister and myself to Mount Erin, telling us to keep it a
secret when we returned, for &ldquo;the sisters,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;would neither
eat nor sleep if reminded of their old home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A pleasant drive brought us to Mount Erin, and when we saw the
box hedges, gravel-walks and linden trees we were no longer surprised
at the grief of the sisters whose hearts entwined around their
old home. The house was in charge of an old negro woman&mdash;the
purchaser not having moved in&mdash;who showed us over the grounds;
and every shrub and flower seemed to speak of days gone by. Even
the ivy on the old bricks looked gloomy as if mourning the light,
mirth and song departed from the house forever; and the walks gave
back a deadened echo, as if they wished not to be disturbed by stranger
tread. All seemed in a reverie, dreaming a long sweet dream of
the past&mdash;and entering into the grief of the sisters, who lived afterwards
many years in a pleasant home, on a pleasant street in Richmond,
with warm friends to serve them, yet their tears never ceased
to flow at mention of Mount Erin.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One more plantation picture, and enough will have been described
to show the character of the homes and people on our plantations.</p>

<p>The last place visited by my sister and myself before the war of
1861, was &ldquo;Elkwood,&rdquo; a fine estate in Culpeper county, four miles
from the railroad station.</p>

<p>It was the last of June. The country was a scene of enchantment,
as the carriage rolled us through dark, cool forests, green meadows,
fields of waving grain; out of the forest into acres of broad leaved
corn; across pebbly-bottomed streams, and along the margin of the
Rapidan which flowed at the base of the hill leading up to the house.</p>

<p>The house was square and white, and the blinds green as the grass
lawn and trees in the yard. Inside the house, the polished &ldquo;dry
rubbed&rdquo; floors clean and cool, refreshed one on entering like a glass
of ice-lemonade on a midsummer&rsquo;s day. The old fashioned furniture
against the walls looked as if it thought too much of itself to be set
about promiscuously over the floor, like modern fauteuils and divans.</p>

<p>About everything was an air of dignity and repose corresponding
with the manners and appearance of the proprietors, who were called
&ldquo;Uncle Dick&rdquo; and &ldquo;Aunt Jenny&rdquo;&mdash;the <i>a</i> in aunt pronounced very
broad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Jenny&rdquo; and &ldquo;Uncle Dick&rdquo; had no children, but took care of
numerous nieces and nephews; kept their house filled to overflowing
with friends, relatives and strangers, and were revered and beloved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
by all. They had no pleasure so great as taking care of other people.
They lived for other people, and made everybody comfortable
and happy around them. From the time &ldquo;Uncle Dick&rdquo; had prayers
in the morning until family prayers at bed time they were busy bestowing
some kindness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle Dick&rsquo;s&rdquo; character and manners were of a type so high that
one felt elevated in his presence; and a desire to reach his standard
animated those who knew him. His precept and example were such
that all who followed them might arrive at the highest perfection of
Christian character.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle Dick&rdquo; had requested &ldquo;Aunt Jenny&rdquo; when they were married&mdash;forty
years before&mdash;to have on his table every day, dinner
enough for six more persons than were already in the house, &ldquo;in case,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;he should meet friends or acquaintances while riding over
his plantation or in the neighborhood, whom he wished to ask home
with him to dinner.&rdquo; This having been always a rule, &ldquo;Aunt Jenny&rdquo;
never sat at her table without dinner enough for six more, and her&rsquo;s
were no commonplace dinners; no hasty puddings; no salaratus
bread; no soda cakes; no frozen-starch-ice-cream; no modern shorthand
recipes&mdash;but genuine old Virginia cooking. And all who want
to know what that was, can find out all about it in &ldquo;Aunt Jenny&rsquo;s&rdquo;
book of copied recipes&mdash;if it is extant&mdash;or in Mrs. Harrison&rsquo;s, of
Brandon. But as neither of these books may ever be known to the
public, their &ldquo;sum and substance&rdquo; may be given in a few words:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have no shams. Procure an abundance of the freshest, richest,
<i>real</i> cream, milk, eggs, butter, lard, best old Madeira wine, all the
way from Madeira, and never use a particle of soda or salaratus
about anything or under any pressure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These were the ingredients &ldquo;Aunt Jenny&rdquo; used&mdash;for &ldquo;Uncle Dick&rdquo;
had rare old wine in his cellar which he had brought from Europe,
thirty years before&mdash;and every day was a feast day at Elkwood.
And the wedding breakfasts &ldquo;Aunt Jenny&rdquo; used to &ldquo;get up&rdquo; when
one of her nieces married at her house&mdash;as they sometimes did&mdash;were
beyond description.</p>

<p>While at Elkwood, observing every day, that the carriage went to
the depot empty, and returned empty, we enquired the reason, and
were informed that &ldquo;Uncle Dick,&rdquo; ever since the cars had been passing
near his plantation, ordered his coachman to have the carriage
every day at the station, &ldquo;in case some of his friends might be on
the train, and might like to stop and see him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another hospitable rule in &ldquo;Uncle Dick&rsquo;s&rdquo; house was, that company
must never be kept &ldquo;waiting&rdquo; in his parlor, and so anxious was
his young niece to meet his approbation in this as in every particular,
that she had a habit of dressing herself carefully, arranging her
hair beautifully&mdash;it was in the days too when smooth hair was fashionable&mdash;before
laying down for the afternoon siesta, &ldquo;in case,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;some one might call, and &lsquo;Uncle Dick&rsquo; had a horror of visitors
waiting.&rdquo; This process of reposing in a fresh muslin dress and
fashionably arranged hair, required a particular and uncomfortable
position, which she seemed not to mind, but dozed in the most precise
manner without rumpling her hair or her dress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>Elkwood was a favorite place of resort for Episcopal ministers,
whom &ldquo;Aunt Jenny&rdquo; and &ldquo;Uncle Dick&rdquo; loved to entertain. And
here we met the Rev. Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;, the learned divine, eloquent
preacher and charming companion. He had just returned from a
visit to England, where he had been entertained in palaces. Telling
us the incidents of his visit, &ldquo;I was much embarrassed at first,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;at the thought of attending a dinner party given in a palace to
me,&mdash;a simple Virginian,&mdash;but on being announced at the drawing-room
door, and entering the company I felt at once at ease, for they
were all ladies and gentlemen&mdash;such as I had known at home, polite,
pleasant and without pretence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This gentleman&rsquo;s conversational powers were not only bright and
delightful, but also the means of turning many to righteousness; for
religion was one of his chief themes.</p>

<p>A proof of his genius and eloquence was given in the beautiful
poem recited&mdash;without ever having been written&mdash;at the centennial
anniversary of old Christ church in Alexandria. This was the church
in which General Washington and his family had worshiped, and
around it clustered many memories. Mr. S., with several others,
had been invited to make an address on the occasion, and one night
while thinking about it an exquisite poem passed through his mind,
picturing scene after scene in the old church. General Washington
with his head bowed in silent prayer; infants at the baptismal font;
young men and maidens in bridal array at the altar, and funeral
trains passing through the open gate.</p>

<p>On the night of the celebration when his turn came, finding the
hour too late, and the audience too sleepy for his prose address, he
suddenly determined to &ldquo;dash off&rdquo; the poem, every word of which
came back to him, although he had never written it. The audience
roused up electrified, and as the recitation proceeded, their enthusiasm
reached the highest pitch. Never had there been such a sensation
in the old church before. And next morning the house at which
he was stopping was besieged by reporters begging &ldquo;copies&rdquo; and
offering good prices, but the poem remains unwritten to this day.</p>

<p>Elkwood&mdash;like many other old homes&mdash;was burned by the Northern
army in 1862, and not a tree or flower remains to mark the spot,
for so many years the abode of hospitality and good cheer.</p>

<p>In connection with Culpeper it is due here to state that this county
excelled all others in ancient and dilapidated buggies and carriages&mdash;seeming
a regular infirmary for all the disabled vehicles of the Old
Dominion. Here their age and infirmities received every care and
consideration, being propped up, tied up and bandaged up in every
conceivable manner; and strangest of all, rarely depositing their occupants
in the road, which was prevented by cautious old gentlemen
riding alongside, who watching out, and discovering the weakest
points, stopped and securely tied up fractured parts with bits of twine,
rope or chain, always carried in buggy or carriage boxes for that
purpose. These surgical operations, although not ornamental,
strengthened and sustained these venerable vehicles, and produced a
longevity miraculous.</p>

<p>Many more sketches might be given of pleasant country homes&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>worthy
a better pen than mine&mdash;for Brandon, Westover, Shirley,
Carter Hall, Lauderdale, Vaucluse, and others, linger in the memory
of hundreds who once knew and loved them. Especially Vaucluse,
which although far removed from railroads, stage coaches and public
conveyances was overflowing with company throughout the year.
For the Vaucluse girls were so bright, so fascinating, so bewitchingly
pretty, they attracted a concourse of visitors, and were sure to be
belles wherever they went.</p>

<p>And many remember the owner of Vaucluse&mdash;that pure hearted
Christian and cultivated gentleman, who, late in life, devoted himself
to the Episcopal ministry, and labored faithfully in the Master&rsquo;s cause
preaching in country churches, &ldquo;without money, and without price.&rdquo;
Surely his reward is in heaven.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Besides these well ordered establishments, there were some others
owned by inactive men, who smoked their pipes, read their books,
left everything very much to the management of their negroes and
seemed content to let things tumble down around them.</p>

<p>One of these places we used to call &ldquo;Topsy-Turvy Castle,&rdquo; and
another &ldquo;Haphazard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At such places the negro quarters&mdash;instead of neat rows of white
cabins in rear of the house, as on other plantations&mdash;occupied a conspicuous
place near the front, and consisted of a solid, long, ugly
brick structure, with swarms of negroes around the windows and
doors, appearing to have nothing in the world to do, and never to
have done anything.</p>

<p>Everything had a &ldquo;shackling,&rdquo; lazy appearance. The master was
always&mdash;it appeared to us&mdash;reading a newspaper in the front porch,
and never observing anything that was going on. The house was
so full of idle negroes standing about the halls and stairways, one
could scarcely make one&rsquo;s way up or down stairs. Everything needed
repair, from the bed you slept upon, to the family coach which
took you to church.</p>

<p>Few of the chairs had all their rounds and legs; and when completely
disabled were sent to the garret, where they accumulated in
great numbers, and remained until pressing necessity induced the
master to raise his eyes from his paper long enough to order &ldquo;Dick&rdquo;
to, &ldquo;take the four-horse-wagon and carry the chairs to be mended.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A multitude of &ldquo;kinsfolk and acquaintance&rdquo; usually congregated
here. And at one place, in order to accommodate so many, there
were four beds in a chamber. These high bedsteads presented a remarkable
appearance&mdash;the head of one going into the side of another,
the foot of one into the head of another, and so on, looking as if they
had never been &ldquo;placed,&rdquo; but their curious juxtaposition had been
the result of some earthquake.</p>

<p>[One of these houses is said to have been greatly improved in appearance
during the war by the passage of a cannon ball through the
upper story, where a window had been needed for many years.]</p>

<p>But the owners of these places were so genuinely good, one could
not complain of them even for such carelessness. For everybody
was welcome to everything. You might stop the plows if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
wanted a horse, or take the carriage and drive for a week&rsquo;s journey,
and, in short, impose upon these good people in every conceivable
way.</p>

<p>Yet in spite of this topsy-turvy management&mdash;a strange fact connected
with such places&mdash;they invariably had good light bread, good
mutton, and the usual abundance on their tables.</p>

<p>We suppose it must have been a recollection of such plantations
which induced the negro to exclaim, on hearing another sing, &ldquo;Ole
Virginny nubber tire.&rdquo; &ldquo;Umph! ole <i>Virginny</i> nubber tire, kase she
nubber done nuthin&rsquo; fur to furtigue herself!&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<p>Confining these reminiscences strictly to plantation life, no mention
has been made of the families we knew and visited in some of
our cities, whose kindness to their slaves was unmistakable, and who
owning only a small number could better afford to indulge them.</p>

<p>At one of these houses, this indulgence was such that the white
family were very much under the control of their servants.</p>

<p>The owner of this house&mdash;an eminent lawyer&mdash;was a man of taste
and learning, whose legal ability attracted many admirers, and whose
refinement, culture and generous nature won enthusiastic friends.</p>

<p>Although considered the owner of his house, it was a mistake&mdash;if
ownership means the right to govern one&rsquo;s own property&mdash;for beyond
his law papers, library and the privilege of paying all the bills,
this gentleman had no &ldquo;rights&rdquo; there whatever; his house, kitchen
and premises being under the entire command of &ldquo;Aunt Fanny,&rdquo; the
cook&mdash;a huge mulatto woman whose word was law, and whose voice
thundered abuse if any dared to disobey her.</p>

<p>The master, mistress, family and visitors all stood in awe of
&ldquo;Aunt Fanny,&rdquo; and yet could not do without her, for she made such
unapproachable light bread, and conducted the affairs of the place
with such distinguished ability.</p>

<p>Her own house was in the yard, and had been built especially for
her convenience. Her furniture was polished mahogany, and she
kept most delicious preserves, pickles and sweet meats of her own
manufacture with which to regale her friends and favorites. As we
came under that head, we were often treated to these when we went
in to see her after her day&rsquo;s work was over, or on Sundays.</p>

<p>Although she &ldquo;raved and stormed&rdquo; considerably&mdash;which she told
us she &ldquo;was obliged to do, <i>honey</i>, to keep things straight&rdquo;&mdash;she had
the tenderest regard for her master and mistress, and often said: &ldquo;If
it warnt for <i>me</i>, they&rsquo;d have nuthin&rsquo; in the world, and things here
would go to destruction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Aunt Fanny &ldquo;kept up this family,&rdquo; as she said, for many years,
and many amusing incidents might be related of her.</p>

<p>On one occasion, her master after a long and excited political contest
was elected to the Legislature. Before all the precincts had
been heard from&mdash;believing himself defeated&mdash;he retired to rest, and
being naturally feeble, was quite worn out. But at midnight a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
cry arose at his gate, where a multitude assembled, screaming
and hurrahing. At first he was uncertain whether they were friends
to congratulate him on his victory, or the opposite party to hang him&mdash;as
they had threatened&mdash;for voting an appropriation to the Danville
railroad. It soon appeared they had come to congratulate him,
when great excitement prevailed, loud cheers and cries for a speech.
The doors were opened and the crowed rushed in. The hero soon appeared
and delivered one of his graceful and satisfactory speeches.</p>

<p>Still the crowd remained cheering and &ldquo;storming&rdquo; about the house,
until Aunt Fanny, who had made her appearance in full dress, considering
the excitement had been kept up long enough, and that the
master&rsquo;s health was too delicate for any further demonstration, determined
to disperse them. Rising to her full height, waving her
hand and speaking majestically she said: &ldquo;Gentlemen! Mars Charles
is a feeble pusson, and it is time for him to take his res&rsquo;. He&rsquo;s been
kep&rsquo; &rsquo;wake long enough now, and it&rsquo;s time for me to close up dese
doors!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this the crowd dispersed and &ldquo;Aunt Fanny&rdquo; remained mistress
of the situation, declaring that, &ldquo;ef she hadn&rsquo;t come forward
and &rsquo;spersed dat crowd, Mars Charles would have been a dead man
befo&rsquo; mornin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Fanny&rdquo; kept herself liberally supplied with pocket money&mdash;one
of her chief sources of revenue being soap, which she made in
large quantities and sold at high prices; especially what she called
her &ldquo;butter soap,&rdquo; which was in great demand, and which was made
from all the butter which she did not consider fresh enough for the
delicate appetites of her mistress and master. She appropriated one
of the largest basement rooms, had it shelved and filled it with soap.
In order to carry on business so extensively huge logs were kept
blazing on the kitchen hearth under the soap pot day and night.
During the war, wood becoming scarce and expensive, &ldquo;Mars
Charles&rdquo; found it drained his purse to keep the kitchen fire supplied.</p>

<p>Thinking the matter over one day in his library, and concluding it
would greatly lessen his expenses if Aunt Fanny could be prevailed
upon to discontinue her soap trade, he sent for her, and said, <i>very
mildly</i>: &ldquo;Fanny, I have a proposition to make you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Mars Charles?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well Fanny, as my expenses are very heavy now, if you will
give up your soap boiling for this year, I will agree to pay you fifty
dollars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With arms akimbo, and looking at him with astonishment, but
firmness in her eye, she replied: &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t possibly do it, Mars
Charles. Because <i>soap</i>, sir, <i>soap&rsquo;s</i> my <i>main</i>-tain-ance!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this she strided majestically out of the room. &ldquo;Mars
Charles&rdquo; said no more but continued paying fabulous sums for wood,
while &ldquo;Aunt Fanny&rdquo; continued boiling her soap.</p>

<p>This woman not only ordered, but kept all the family supplies, her
mistress having no disposition to keep the keys or in any way interfere
with her.</p>

<p>But at last her giant strength gave way, and she sickened and died.
Having no children she left her property to one of her fellow servants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>Several days before her death, we were sitting with her mistress
and master in a room overlooking her house. Her room was crowded
with negroes who had come to perform their religious rites around
the death bed. Joining hands they performed a savage dance, shouting
wildly around her bed. This was horrible to hear and see,
especially as in this family every effort had been made to instruct
their negro dependents in the truths of religion; and one member of
the family, who spent the greater part of her life in prayer, had for
years prayed for &ldquo;Aunt Fanny,&rdquo; and tried to instruct her in the true
faith. But although an intelligent woman, she seemed to cling to
the superstitions of her race.</p>

<p>After the savage dance and rites were over, and while we sat talking
about it, a gentleman&mdash;the friend and minister of the family&mdash;came
in. We described to him what we had just witnessed, and he
deplored it bitterly with us, saying he had read and prayed with
&ldquo;Aunt Fanny&rdquo; and tried to make her see the truth in Jesus. He then
marked some passages in the Bible, and asked me to go and read
them to her. I went, and said to her: &ldquo;Aunt Fanny, here are some
verses Mr. Mitchell has marked for me to read to you, and he hopes
you will pray to the Savior as he taught you.&rdquo; Then said I, &ldquo;we are
afraid the noise and dancing have made you worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Speaking feebly, she replied: &ldquo;Honey, that kind of religion suits
us black folks better than your kind. What suits Mars Charles&rsquo;
mind, don&rsquo;t suit mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And thus died the most intelligent of her race&mdash;one who had been
surrounded by pious persons who had been praying for her, and endeavoring
to instruct her. She had also enjoyed through life not only
the comforts, but many of the luxuries of earth&mdash;and when she died,
her mistress and master lost a sincere friend.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<p>This chapter will show how &ldquo;Virginia beat-biscuit&rdquo; procured for a
man a home and friends in Paris.</p>

<p>One morning in the spring of 18&mdash; a singular looking man presented
himself at our house. He was short of stature, and enveloped in furs
although the weather was not cold. Everything about him was gold
which could be gold, and so we called him &ldquo;the gold-tipped-man.&rdquo;
He called for my mother, and when she went in the parlor said to her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam I have been stopping several weeks at the hotel in the
town of L&mdash;&mdash;, where I met a boy&mdash;Robert&mdash;who tells me he belongs
to you. As I want such a servant, and he is anxious to travel, I
come, at his request, to ask if you will let me buy him and take him
to Europe. I will pay any price.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not think of it,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I have determined never to
sell one of my servants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued the man, &ldquo;he is anxious to go, and has sent me
to beg you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is impossible,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;for he is a great favorite with us, and
the only child his mother has.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>Finding her determined, the man took his leave, and went back to
the town, twenty-five miles off; but returned next day accompanied
by Robert, who entreated his mother and mistress to let him go.</p>

<p>Said my mother to him: &ldquo;Would you leave your mother and go
with a stranger to a foreign land?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, madam. I love my mother, and you and all your family&mdash;you
have always been so good to me&mdash;but I want to travel, and this
gentleman says he will give me plenty of money and be very kind to
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still she refused. But the boy&rsquo;s mother, finally yielding to his entreaty,
consented, and persuaded her mistress, saying, &ldquo;if he is willing
to leave me, and so anxious to go I will give him up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Knowing how distressed we all would be at parting with him, he
went off without coming to say &ldquo;good bye,&rdquo; and wrote his mother
from New York what day he would sail with his new master for
Europe.</p>

<p>At first his mother received from him presents and letters, telling
her he was very much delighted, and &ldquo;had as much money as he
knew what to do with.&rdquo; But after a few months he ceased to write,
and we could hear nothing from him.</p>

<p>At length, when eighteen months had elapsed, one day we were
astonished to see him return home, dressed in the best Parisian style.
We were rejoiced to see him again, and his own joy at getting back
cannot be described. He ran over the yard and house examining
everything, and said: &ldquo;Mistress, I have seen many fine places in
Europe, but none to me as pretty as this, and I have seen no lady
equal to you. And I have had no water to drink as good as this&mdash;and
I have dreamed about every chair and table in this house, and
wondered if I would ever get back here again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He then gave us a sketch of his life since the &ldquo;gold-tipped&rdquo; man
had become his master. Arrived in Paris, his master and himself
took lodgings at the Hotel de Ville. A teacher was employed to
come every day and instruct Robert in French. His master kept him
well supplied with money, never giving him less than fifty dollars at
a time. His duties were light, and he had ample time to study and
amuse himself.</p>

<p>After enjoying such elegant ease for eight or nine months, he waked
one morning and found himself deserted and penniless! His master
had absconded in the night, leaving no vestige of himself except a
gold dressing case and a few toilette articles of gold, which were
seized by the proprietor of the hotel in payment of his bill.</p>

<p>Poor Robert, without money and without a friend in this great city,
knew not where to turn. In vain he wished himself back in his old
home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I could only find some Virginian to whom I could appeal,&rdquo; said
he to himself. And suddenly it occurred to him that the American
Minister, Mr. Mason, was a Virginian. When he remembered this
his heart was cheered, and he lost no time in finding Mr. Mason&rsquo;s
house.</p>

<p>Presenting himself before the American Minister, he related his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
story, which was not at first believed. &ldquo;For,&rdquo; said Mr. Mason, &ldquo;there
are so many impostors in Paris, it is impossible to believe you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert protested he had been a slave in Virginia&mdash;had been deserted
by his owner in Paris, and begged Mr. Mason to keep him at his
house, and take care of him.</p>

<p>Then Mr. M. asked many questions about people and places in
Virginia, all which were accurately answered. Finally, he said:
&ldquo;I knew well the Virginia gentleman who was, you say, your master.
What was the color of his hair?&rdquo; This was also satisfactorily
answered, and Robert began to hope he was believed, when Mr.
Mason continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now there is one thing, which if you can do, will convince me
you came from Virginia. Go in my kitchen and make me some old
Virginia beat-biscuit, and I will believe everything you have said!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I can do that, sir,&rdquo; said Robert, and going in the kitchen,
rolled up his sleeves and set to work.</p>

<p>This was a desperate moment, for he had never made a biscuit in
his life, although he had often watched the proceeding as &ldquo;Black
Mammy,&rdquo; the cook at home, used to beat, roll and manipulate the
dough on her biscuit box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I only could make them look like her&rsquo;s!&rdquo; thought he, as he beat,
and rolled, and worked and finally stuck the dough all over with a
fork. Then cutting them out, and putting them to bake, he watched
them with nervous anxiety until they resembled those he had often
placed on the table at home.</p>

<p>Astonished and delighted with his success, he carried them to the
American Minister, who exclaimed: &ldquo;Now I <i>know</i> you came from old
Virginia!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert was immediately installed in Mr. M.&rsquo;s house, where he remained
a faithful attendant until Mr. Mason&rsquo;s death, when he returned
with the family to America.</p>

<p>Arriving at New York he thought it impossible to get along by
himself, and determined to find his master. For this purpose he
employed a policeman, and together they succeeded in recovering &ldquo;the
lost master&rdquo;&mdash;this being a singular instance of a &ldquo;slave in pursuit of
his fugitive master.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;gold-tipped&rdquo; man expressed much pleasure at his servant&rsquo;s
fidelity, and handing him a large sum of money desired him to return
to Paris, pay his bill, bring back his gold dressing box and toilette
articles, and, as a reward for his fidelity, take as much money as he
wished and travel over the continent.</p>

<p>Robert obeyed these commands, returned to Paris, paid the bills,
traveled over the chief places in Europe and then came again to New
York. Here he was appalled to learn that his master had been
arrested for forgery, and imprisoned in Philadelphia. It was ascertained
that the forger was an Englishman and connected with an
underground forging establishment in Paris. Finding himself about
to be detected in Paris he fled to New York, and other forgeries having
been discovered in Philadelphia, he had been arrested.</p>

<p>Robert lost no time in reporting himself at the prison, and was
grieved to find his master in such a place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>Determining to do what he could to relieve the man who had been
a good friend to him, he went to a Philadelphia lawyer, and said to
him: &ldquo;Sir, the man who is in prison, bought me in Virginia, and has
been a kind master to me; I have no money, but if you will do your
best to have him acquitted, I will return to the South, sell myself
and send you the money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a bargain,&rdquo; replied the lawyer. &ldquo;Send me the money, and
I will save your master from the penitentiary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert returned to Baltimore, sold himself to a Jew in that city,
and sent the money to the lawyer in Philadelphia. After this he
was bought by a distinguished Southern Senator&mdash;afterwards a General
in the Southern army&mdash;with whom he remained, and to whom
he rendered valuable services during the war.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Other instances were known of negroes who preferred being sold
into slavery rather than take care of themselves. There were some
in our immediate neighborhood, who finding themselves emancipated
by their master&rsquo;s will, begged the owners of neighboring plantations
to buy them, saying they preferred having &ldquo;white people to take care
of them.&rdquo; On the &ldquo;Wheatly&rdquo; plantation&mdash;not far from us&mdash;there is
still living an old negro who sold himself in this way, and cannot be
persuaded <i>now</i> to accept his freedom. After the war, when all the
negroes were freed by the Federal Government, and our people too
much impoverished longer to clothe and feed them, this old man refused
to leave the plantation, but clung to his cabin, although his
wife and family moved off and begged him to accompany them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I nuver will leave this plantation, and go off to
starve with free niggers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not even when his wife was very sick and dying could he be persuaded
to go off and stay one night with her. He had long been too
old to work, but his former owners indulged him by giving him his
cabin, and taking care of him through all the poverty which has fallen
upon our land since the war.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>

<p>O, bright winged peace! Long did&rsquo;st thou rest o&rsquo;er the homes of
old Virginia; while cheerful wood fires blazed on hearthstones in
parlor and cabin, reflecting contented faces with hearts full of &ldquo;peace
and good will towards men!&rdquo; No thought entered there of harm to
others; no fear of evil to ourselves. Whatsoever things were honest;
whatsoever things were pure; whatsoever things were gentle; whatsoever
things were of good report, we were accustomed to hear &rsquo;round
these parlor firesides; and often would our grandmothers say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Children our&rsquo;s is a blessed country! There never will be another
war! The Indians have long ago been driven out, and it has been
nearly a hundred years since the English yoke was broken!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The history of our country was contained in two pictures: &ldquo;The
last battle with the Indians&rdquo; and &ldquo;The surrender of Lord Cornwallis
at Yorktown.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>No enemies within or without our borders, and peace established
among us forever! Such was our belief. And we wondered that
men should get together and talk their dry politics, seeing that General
Washington and Thomas Jefferson&mdash;two of our Virginia plantation
men&mdash;had established a government to last as long as the earth,
and which could not be improved. Yet they <i>would</i> talk&mdash;these politicians&mdash;around
our parlor fire, where often our patience was exhausted
hearing discussions, in which we could not take interest,
about the &ldquo;Protective Tariff;&rdquo; the &ldquo;Bankrupt Law;&rdquo; the &ldquo;Distribution
of Public Lands;&rdquo; the &ldquo;Resolutions of &rsquo;98;&rdquo; the &ldquo;Missouri
Compromise,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Monroe Doctrine.&rdquo; These topics seemed
to afford them intense pleasure and satisfaction, for as the &ldquo;sparks
fly upward&rdquo; the thoughts of men turn to politics.</p>

<p>Feeling no ill will towards any tribe, people or nation on the globe,
and believing that all felt a friendly regard for us, how could we
believe, when we heard it, that a nation not far off&mdash;to whom we
had yearly &ldquo;carried up&rdquo; a tithe of all we possessed, and whose
coffers we helped to fill&mdash;were subscribing large sums of money to
destroy us? We could not, would not believe it. Yet we were told
that this nation&mdash;towards whom we felt no animosity&mdash;brought up
their children to believe that they would do God service by reviling
and persecuting us. Nay more&mdash;that their ministers of the gospel
preached unto them thus:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou shalt carry fire and sword into the land that lieth South of
you. Thou shalt make it a desolate waste. Thou shalt utterly root
out and annihilate the people that they be no more a people. Thou
shalt write books. Thou shalt form societies for the purpose of
planning the best means of attacking secretly and destroying this
people. Thou shalt send emissaries. Thou shalt stir up the nations
abroad against them. Thou shalt prepare weapons of war, and in
every way incite their negroes to rise at night and slay them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Around our firesides we asked: &ldquo;Can this be true?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alas! alas! it was true; and the first expedition sent against us
was led by a man from the Adirondack Mountains in the North, who
in 1859, with a small band armed with pikes, clubs and guns, attacked
one of our villages at night.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The news of this blanched the cheeks of our maidens, and the
children nestled closer round their mother&rsquo;s knee at evening twilight,
for who could tell what might befall our plantation homes before
morning! The hearts of women and children grew sick and faint.
But the hearts of our men and boys grew brave and strong&mdash;and
would they have been the countrymen of Washington had they not
thought of war?</p>

<p>About this time we had a visit from two old friends of our family&mdash;a
distinguished Southern Senator and the Secretary of War&mdash;both
accustomed to swaying multitudes by the power of their eloquence&mdash;which
lost none of its force and charm in our little home circle. We
listened with admiration as they discussed the political issues of the
day&mdash;no longer a subject uninteresting or unintelligible to us, for
every word was of vital importance. Their theme was, &ldquo;the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
means of protecting our plantation homes and firesides.&rdquo; Even the
smallest children now comprehended the greatest politicians.</p>

<p>Now came the full flow and tide of Southern eloquence&mdash;real,
soul-inspiring eloquence!</p>

<p>Many possessing this gift were in the habit of visiting us at that
time; and all dwelt upon one theme&mdash;the secession of Virginia&mdash;with
glowing words from hearts full of enthusiasm; all agreeing it
was better for States, as well as individuals, to separate rather than
quarrel or fight.</p>

<p>But there was one&mdash;our oldest and best friend&mdash;who differed with
these gentlemen; and his eloquence was gentle and effective. Unlike
his friends whose words, earnest and electric, overwhelmed
all around, this gentleman&rsquo;s power was in his composure of manner
without vehemence. His words were well selected without seeming
to have been studied; each sentence was short, but contained a gem,
like a solitaire diamond.</p>

<p>For several months this gentleman remained untouched by the
fiery eloquence of his friends&mdash;like the Hebrew children in the burning
furnace. Nothing affected him until one day, the President of
the United States demanded by telegraph 50,000 Virginians to join
an army against South Carolina. And then this gentleman felt convinced
it was not the duty of Virginians to join an army against
their friends.</p>

<p>About this time we had some very interesting letters from the Hon.
Edward Everett&mdash;who had been for several years a friend and agreeable
correspondent&mdash;giving us his views on the subject, and very
soon after this all communication between the North and South
ceased, except through the blockade, for four long years.</p>

<p>And then came the long dark days; the days when the sun seemed
to shine no more; when the eyes of wives, mothers and sisters were
heavy with weeping; when men sat up late in the night studying
military tactics; when grief-burdened hearts turned to God in prayer.</p>

<p>The intellectual gladiators who had discoursed eloquently of war
around our fireside, buckled their armor on and went forth to battle.</p>

<p>Band after band of brave-hearted, bright-faced youths from Southern
plantation homes came to bleed and die on Virginia soil; and
for four long years old Virginia was one great camping ground,
hospital and battle field. The roar of cannon and the clash of arms
resounded over the land. The groans of the wounded and dying
went up from hillside and valley. The hearts of women and children
were sad and careworn. But God, to whom they prayed, protected
them in our plantation homes&mdash;where no white men or even boys
remained&mdash;all having gone into the army. Only the negro slaves
stayed with us, and these were encouraged by our enemies to rise
and slay us; but God in His mercy willed otherwise. Although advised
to burn our property and incited by the enemy to destroy their
former owners, these negro slaves remained faithful, manifesting
kindness, and in many instances protecting the white families and
plantations during their masters&rsquo; absence.</p>

<p>Oh! the long terrible nights helpless women and children passed,
in our plantation homes; the enemy encamped around them; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
clash of swords heard against the doors and windows; the report of
guns on the air which might be sending death to their loved ones.</p>

<p>But why try to describe the horrors of such nights? Who that
has not experienced them can know how we felt? Who can imagine
the heart sickness, when stealing to an upper window at midnight
we watched the fierce flames rising from some neighboring home,
expecting our own to be destroyed by the enemy before daylight in
the same way?</p>

<p>Such pictures, dark and fearful, were the only ones familiar to us
in old Virginia those four dreadful years.</p>

<p>At last the end came&mdash;the end which seemed to us saddest of all.
But God knoweth best. Though &ldquo;through fiery trials&rdquo; He had caused
us to pass, He had not forsaken us. For was not His mercy signally
shown in the failure of the enemy to incite our negro slaves to insurrection
during the war? Through His mercy those who were expected
to become our enemies, remained our friends. And in our
own home, surrounded by the enemy those terrible nights, our only
guard was a faithful negro servant who slept in the house, and went
out every hour to see if we were in immediate danger; while his
mother&mdash;the kind old nurse&mdash;sat all night in a rocking chair in our
room, ready to help us. Had we not then amidst all our sorrows
much to be thankful for?</p>

<p>Among such scenes one of the last pictures photographed on my
memory, was that of a negro boy very ill with typhoid fever in a
cabin not far off, and who became greatly alarmed when a brisk
firing commenced between the contending armies across our house.
His first impulse&mdash;as it always had been in trouble&mdash;was to fly to
his mistress for protection; and jumping from his bed&mdash;his head
bandaged with a white cloth, and looking like one just from the
grave&mdash;he passed through the firing as fast as he could, screaming:
&ldquo;O, mistress, take care of me! Put me in your closet, and hide me
from the Yankees!&rdquo; He fell at the door exhausted. My mother had
him brought in and a bed made for him in the library. She nursed
him carefully, but he died in a day or two from fright and exhaustion.</p>

<p>Soon after this was the surrender at Appomattox, and negro slavery
ended forever.</p>

<p>All was ruin around us; tobacco factories burned down, sugar and
cotton plantations destroyed. The negroes fled from these desolated
places, crowded together in wretched shanties on the outskirts of
towns and villages, and found themselves, for the first time in their
lives, without enough to eat, and with no class of people particularly
interested about their food, health or comfort. Rations were furnished
them a short time by the United States Government, with promises
of money and land, which were never fulfilled. Impoverished by the
war, it was a relief to us no longer to have the responsibility of supporting
them. This would indeed have been impossible in our starving
condition.</p>

<p>Twelve years have passed since they became free, but they have
not, during this time, advanced in intelligence or comfort. Wanting
the care of their owners, they die more frequently; and, it is thought,&mdash;by
those who have studied the subject&mdash;that abandoned to them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>selves,
they are returning to the superstitions of their forefathers.
A missionary recently returned from Africa, and witnessing here
their religious rites, says they are the same he saw practiced before
the idols in Africa.</p>

<p>They still have a strange belief in what they call &ldquo;tricking,&rdquo; and
often the most intelligent, when sick, will say they have been &ldquo;tricked,&rdquo;
for which they have a regular treatment and &ldquo;trick doctors&rdquo;
among themselves. This &ldquo;tricking&rdquo; we cannot explain, and only
know that when one negro became angry with another, he would
bury in front of his enemy&rsquo;s cabin door a bottle filled with pieces of
snakes, spiders, bits of tadpole, and other curious substances; and
the party expecting to be &ldquo;tricked,&rdquo; would hang up an old horse shoe
outside of his door to ward off the &ldquo;evil spirits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Since alienated from their former owners they are, as a general
thing, more idle and improvident; and, unfortunately, the tendency of
their political teaching has been to make them antagonistic to the
better class of white people, which renders it difficult for them to be
properly instructed. That such animosity should exist towards those
who could best understand and help them, is to be deplored. For
the true negro character cannot be fully comprehended or described,
but by those who&mdash;like ourselves&mdash;have always lived with them.</p>

<p>At present their lives are devoted to a religious excitement which
demoralizes them, there seeming to be no connection between their
religion and morals. In one of their Sabbath schools is a teacher,
who although often arrested for stealing, continues to hold a high
position in the church.</p>

<p>Their improvidence has passed into a proverb&mdash;many being truly
objects of charity; and whoever would now write a true tale of poverty
and wretchedness, may take for the hero &ldquo;Old Uncle Tom
without a cabin.&rdquo; For &ldquo;Uncle Tom&rdquo; of the olden time in his cabin
with a blazing log fire and plenty of corn bread, and the Uncle Tom
of to-day, are pictures of very different individuals.</p>

<p>And this chapter ends my reminiscences of an era soon to be forgotten,
and which will perish under the heel of modern progress. It
is a faithful memorial. Would that it might rescue from oblivion
some of the characters worthy to be remembered!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>

<p>The scenes connected with the late war will recall to the mind of
every Southern man and woman the name of Robert E. Lee&mdash;a name
which will be loved and revered as long as home or fireside remains
in old Virginia&mdash;and which sets the crowning glory on the list of
illustrious men from plantation homes. Admiration and enthusiasm
naturally belong to victory; but the man must be rare indeed, who
in defeat, like General Lee, received the applause of his countrymen.</p>

<p>It was not alone his valor, his handsome appearance, his commanding
presence, his perfect manner, which won the admiration of
his fellow-men. There was something above and beyond all these&mdash;his
true Christian character. Trust in God ennobled his every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
word and action. Among the grandest of human conquerors was
he, for early enlisting as a soldier of the cross&mdash;to fight against the
world, the flesh and the devil&mdash;he fought the &ldquo;good fight&rdquo; and the
victor&rsquo;s crown awaited him in the &ldquo;kingdom not made with hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trust in God kept him calm in victory as in defeat. When I remember
General Lee during the war, in his family circle at Richmond&mdash;then
at the height of his renown&mdash;his manner, voice and conversation
were the same as when, a year after the surrender, he came
to make my mother a visit from his Lexington home.</p>

<p>His circumstances and surroundings were now changed&mdash;no longer
the stars and epaulets adorned his manly form; but dressed in a
simple suit of pure white linen, he looked a king, and adversity had
wrought no change in his character, manner, or conversation.</p>

<p>To reach our house he made a journey&mdash;on his old war horse,
&ldquo;Traveler&rdquo;&mdash;forty miles across the mountains, describing which, on
the night of his arrival, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-day an incident occurred which gratified me more than anything
that has happened for a long time. As I was riding over the
most desolate mountain region, where not even a cabin could be
seen, I was surprised to find, on a sudden turn in the road, two little
girls playing on a large rock. They were very poorly clad, and
after looking a moment at me, began to run away. &lsquo;Children,&rsquo; said
I, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t run away. If you could know <i>who</i> I am, you would know
that I am the last man in the world for anybody to run from now.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But we do know you,&rsquo; they replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You never saw me before,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;for I never passed along
here.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But we do know you,&rsquo; they said, &lsquo;And we&rsquo;ve got your picture
up yonder in the house, and you are General Lee! And we ain&rsquo;t
dressed clean enough to see you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With this they scampered off to a poor log hut on the mountain
side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was gratifying to him to find that even in this lonely mountain
hut the children had been taught to know and revere him.</p>

<p>He told us, too, of a man he met the same day in a dense forest
who recognized him, and throwing up his hat in the air, said:
&ldquo;General, <i>please</i> let me cheer you,&rdquo; and fell to cheering with all his
lungs!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>My last recollections of General Lee, when making a visit of several
weeks at his house, the year before his death&mdash;although not
coming properly under the head of &ldquo;plantation reminiscences&rdquo;&mdash;may
not be inappropriate here.</p>

<p>It has been said that a man is never a &ldquo;hero to his valet;&rdquo; but
this could not have been said of General Lee, for those most intimately
connected with him could not fail to see continually in his bearing
and character something above the ordinary level, something of the
hero.</p>

<p>At the time of my visit the commencement exercises of the College,
of which he was President, were going on. His duties were necessarily
onerous. Sitting up late at night with the board of visitors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
and attending to every detail with his conscientious particularity,
there was little time for him to rest. Yet every morning of that
busy week he was ready, with his prayer-book under his arm, when
the church bell called its members to sun-rise service.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to recall all he said at the breakfast, dinner and tea
table, where in his hospitality he always insisted upon bringing all
who chanced to be at his house at those hours&mdash;on business or on
social call.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>This habit kept his table filled with guests, who received from him
elegant courtesy.</p>

<p>Only once did I hear him speak regretfully of the past. It was
one night when sitting by him on the porch in the moonlight, he
said to me, his thoughts turning to his early childhood:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not my mother&rsquo;s wish that I should receive a military education,
and I ought to have taken her advice, for,&rdquo; he said very sadly,
&ldquo;my education did not fit me for this civil life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this no one could agree with him, for it seemed to all that he
adorned and satisfactorily filled every position in life, civil or military.</p>

<p>There was something in his manner which naturally pleased every
one without his making an effort; at the same time a dignity and
reserve which commanded respect and precluded anything like undue
familiarity. All desirable qualities seemed united in him to render
him popular.</p>

<p>It was wonderful to observe&mdash;in the evenings when his parlors
were overflowing with people young and old, from every conceivable
place&mdash;how by a word, a smile, a shake of the hand he managed to
give <i>all</i> pleasure and satisfaction, each going away charmed with
him.</p>

<p>The applause of men excited in him no vanity; for those around
soon learned that the slightest allusion or compliment, in his presence,
to his valor or renown, instead of pleasing, rather offended
him. Without vanity, he was equally without selfishness.</p>

<p>One day, observing several quaint articles of furniture about his
house, and asking Mrs. Lee where they came from, she told me that
an old lady in New York city&mdash;of whom neither herself nor the General
had ever before heard&mdash;concluded to break up housekeeping.
Having no family and not wishing to sell or remove her furniture to
a boarding house, she determined to give it to &ldquo;the <i>greatest living
man</i>,&rdquo; and that man was General Lee.</p>

<p>She wrote a letter asking his acceptance of the present, requesting
that, if his house was already furnished and he had no room, he
would use the articles about his College.</p>

<p>The boxes arrived. But&mdash;such was his reluctance at receiving
gifts&mdash;weeks passed and he neither had them opened or brought
to his house from the express office.</p>

<p>Finally, as their house was quite bare of furniture, Mrs. Lee begged
him to allow her to have them opened, and he consented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>First there was among the contents a beautiful carpet large enough
for two rooms, at which she was delighted, as they had none. But
the General, seeing it, quickly said: &ldquo;That is the very thing for the
floor of the new chapel! It must be put there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next were two sofas and a set of chairs. &ldquo;The very things we
want,&rdquo; again exclaimed the General, &ldquo;for the platform of the new
chapel!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they unpacked a side-board. &ldquo;This will do <i>very well</i>,&rdquo; said
the General, &ldquo;to be placed in the basement of the chapel to hold the
College papers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so with everything the old lady sent, only keeping for his
own house the articles which could not be possibly used for the College
or chapel&mdash;a quaint work-table, an ornamental clock and some
old fashioned preserve dishes&mdash;although his own house was then
bare enough, and the old lady had particularly requested that only
those articles which they did not need should go to the College.</p>

<p>The recollection of this visit, although reviving many pleasant
hours, is very sad, for it was the last time I saw the dear, kind face
of Mrs. Lee; of whom the General once said when one of us, alluding
to him, used the word &ldquo;hero:&rdquo; &ldquo;My dear, <i>Mrs.</i> Lee is the hero.
For although deprived of the use of her limbs, by suffering, and unable
for ten years to walk I have never heard her murmur or utter
one complaint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the General spoke truly, Mrs. Lee was a heroine. With gentleness,
kindness and true feminine delicacy, she had strength of mind
and character a man might have envied. Her mind well stored and
cultivated made her interesting in conversation; and a simple cordiality
of manner made her beloved by all who met her.</p>

<p>During this last visit she loved to tell about her early days at
Arlington&mdash;her own and her ancestors&rsquo; plantation home&mdash;and in one
of these conversations gave me such a beautiful sketch of her mother&mdash;Mrs.
Custis&mdash;that I wish her every word could be remembered
that I might write it here.</p>

<p>Mrs. Custis was a woman of saintly piety, her devotion to good
works having long been a theme with all in that part of Virginia.
She had only one child&mdash;Mrs. Lee&mdash;and possessed a very large fortune.
In early life she felt that God had given her a special mission,
which was to take care of and teach the three hundred negroes she
had inherited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Believing this,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lee to me, &ldquo;my mother devoted the
best years of her life to teaching these negroes, for which purpose
she had a school house built in the yard, and gave her life up to this
work; and I think it an evidence of the ingratitude of their race, that
although I have long been afflicted, only one of those negroes has
written to enquire after me, or offered to nurse me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These last years of Mrs. Lee&rsquo;s life were passed in much suffering,
being unable to move any part of her body except her hands and
head. Yet her time was devoted to working for her church. Her
fingers were always busy with fancy work, painting or drawing&mdash;she
was quite an accomplished artist&mdash;which were sold for the purpose
of repairing and beautifying the church in sight of her window,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and as much an object of zeal and affection with her, as the chapel
was with the General.</p>

<p>Indeed the whole family entered into the General&rsquo;s enthusiasm
about this chapel&mdash;just then completed&mdash;especially his daughter
Agnes, with whom I often went there, little thinking it was so soon
to be her place of burial.</p>

<p>In a few short years all three&mdash;General Lee, his wife and daughter&mdash;were
laid here to rest, and this chapel they had loved so well
became their tomb.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>

<p>All plantation reminiscences resemble a certain patch-work, made
when we were children, of bright pieces joined with black squares.
The black squares were not pretty, but if left out, the character of
the quilt was lost. And so with the black faces, if left out of our
home pictures of the past, the character of the picture is destroyed.</p>

<p>What I have written is a simple record of facts in my experience
without an imaginary scene or character; intended for the descendants
of those who owned slaves in the South, and who may in future
wish to know something of the high-toned character and virtues of
their ancestors.</p>

<p>The pictures are strictly true, and should it be thought by any that
the brightest have alone been selected, I can only say, I knew no
others.</p>

<p>It would not be possible for any country to be entirely exempt
from crime and wickedness; and here, too, these existed; for prisons,
penitentiaries and courts of justice were, as elsewhere, important;
but it is a sincere belief that the majority of Southern people were
true and good. And that they have accomplished more than any
other nation towards civilizing and elevating the negro race, may be
shown from the following paragraph in a late magazine:</p>

<p>&ldquo;From a very early date the French had their establishment on
the Western coast of Africa. In 1364 their ships visited that portion
of the world. But with all this long intercourse with the white man
the natives have profited little. <i>Five centuries</i> have not civilized them,
so as to be able to build up institutions of their own. Yet the
French have always succeeded better than the English with the negro
and Indian element.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Civilization and education are slow; for, says a modern writer:</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the death of Roman intellectual activity, the seventh and
eighth centuries were justly called dark. If Christianity was to be
one of the factors in producing the present splendid enlightenment,
she had no time to lose, and she lost no time. She was the only
power at that day that could begin the work of enlightenment. And
starting at the very bottom, she wrought for <i>nine hundred years</i> alone.
The materials she had to work upon, were stubborn and unmalleable.
<i>For one must be somewhat civilized to have a taste for knowledge at all; and
one must know something to be civilized at all.</i> She had to carry on the
double work of civilizing and educating. Her progress was neces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>sarily
slow at first. <i>But after some centuries</i> it began to increase in
arithmetical progression until the sixteenth century.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then our ancestors performed a great work&mdash;the work allotted
them by God, civilizing and elevating an inferior race in the scale of
intelligence and comfort. That this race may continue to improve,
and finally be the means of carrying the gospel into their native
Africa, should be the prayer of every earnest Christian.</p>

<p>Never again will the negro race find a people so kind and true to
them as the Southerners have been. For, said a gentleman the other
day, who lives in New York, &ldquo;In the Northern cities white labor is
preferred, and the negroes are to be found on the outskirts, poor,
wretched and friendless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is much in our lives not intended for us to comprehend or
explain; but believing that nothing happens by chance, and that our
forefathers have done their duty in the &ldquo;place it had pleased God to
call them,&rdquo; let us cherish their memory, and remember that the Lord
God Omnipotent reigneth.</p>
